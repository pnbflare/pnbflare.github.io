				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday an unlikely group of middle school students on the Greenwich Youth Football League’s BANC Raiders football team head to the playoffs with a proud 3-5 record.</p>
<p>While possessing a sub-500 percent record, the coach and players, along with the Byram community recognize the odds they have to overcome against some of the other opponents.</p>
<p>The BANC Raiders will dress 15 players this Sunday, Nov 12 for their playoff bout against the Cos Cob Crushers who are 8-0.</p>
<p>“Our record may be sub-500, but this is a team of winners. These young men have fought the odds, challenged expectations, and come out on the field with great community spirit and incredible resiliency,” said Coach Richard Muskus Jr. “I’m incredibly proud of the inspiration they have become.”  Muskus, who played three years of NCAA college football, also happens to be President of Stamford based Patriot Bank.</p>
<p>The story of the team’s climb, from having zero coaching staff at all to making the playoffs, began three years ago when Muskus was asked to “lend a hand” for a team of 12 and 13 year old’s sponsored by the Byram Archibald Neighborhood Center.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot’s Banking Staff Up 42% in City of Stamford</p>
<p>Patriot Bancorp, N.A. (PNBK) announces that Scott Laughinghouse, a 30 year community banking veteran, has joined to serve in the senior capacity of Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer.</p>
<p>As Chief Lending Officer, he will manage the bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, supervise the lending teams and work to ensure the community bank’s long term profit growth. Mr. Laughinghouse will report to and work directly with the bank’s President, Richard A. Muskus Jr.</p>
<p>He previously served as Chief Lending Officer and Senior Vice President of the First American International Bank in Brooklyn, NY. Before that, he was<br />
Chief Commercial Credit and Lending officer at Lake Sunapee Bank in Newport, NH as well as Senior Lender and Chief Credit Officer at the Saving Bank of Walpole in Keene, NH.</p>
<p>“Scott’s depth and range of experience in lending will bring incredible value to Patriot Bank and our banking teams. His addition will support the continued expansion of Patriot’s market and footprint,” said Mr. Muskus. “Patriot is committed to attracting the best, brightest and most talented financial industry professionals to serve our customers, the communities where we are centered and our shareholders alike. His experience adds even more value to an already strong banking team.”</p>
<p>In the City of Stamford where Patriot is headquartered, the bank has been significantly increasing the number of bankers it employs. That headcount has continued to grow by 42% in the last 18 months from 50 at its 900 Bedford Street headquarters to 71 at the end of 2017.</p>
<p>So far in 2017 Patriot Bank has achieved and surpassed many financial and banking milestones. As of September 30, 2016, total assets increased $144 million (up 21%) to $826 million. Deposits continued to rise and are now up 28% year-over-year at $605 million (up $134 million) with loans totaling $710 million, an increase of 27% from the $560 million reported one year earlier. The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.</p>
<p>In August, Patriot announced its pending acquisition of Prime Bank of Orange, Connecticut. It was announced last week that Prime Bank shareholders voted in favor of its merger with Patriot. As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $56 million in deposits and $28 million in total loans. Closing is pending receipt of regulatory approvals, which is targeted before year-end.</p>
<p>Mr. Laughinghouse earned a Bachelor in Economics from Middlebury College and has served on the board of the West Central Behavioral Health Center in Lebanon, NH, and on the board of YMCA’s Camp Takodah in Richmond, NH, as well as serving as a youth baseball, soccer and basketball coach.</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting on Connecticut&#8217;s and the nation&#8217;s community banks, results of the unrelenting burden of tightened regulations while staying abreast of fast-moving, expensive mobile-banking technologies in the Internet Age.</p>
<p>Recent evidence of the quaking bank landscape in Connecticut and New England was Bankers&#8217; Bank Northeast&#8217;s (BBN) Aug. 2 announcement of its pending $17 million stock acquisition by Pennsylvania rival, Atlantic Community Bankers Bank.</p>
<p>BBN serves the correspondent-banking needs of its 175 or so Connecticut community banks, and a handful of credit unions, with such services as check and wire transfers processing. As members, those institutions also are investors in BBN.</p>
<p>Craig Howie, BBN&#8217;s president and chief executive and technology officer, said regulatory and technology pressures have sparked a raft of bank mergers nationwide and in the Northeast, making it difficult for BBN to recruit more banks as clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to see the same thing in Connecticut,&#8221; Howie told HBJ on Aug. 2, the day BBN and Atlantic Community, of suburban Harrisburg, Pa., announced their pending $17 million merger.</p>
<p>Later that same day, Stamford community lender Patriot National Bank announced it was acquiring much-smaller Prime Bank in Orange. Prime cited the opportunity to leverage Patriot&#8217;s capital base to expand services to Prime customers.</p>

<p class="Glypha-Drop-Cap"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">F</span>or an institution that was once near the brink of collapse, Patriot National Bank has made an impressive comeback — and it’s not done yet, according to chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza.</p>
<p class="Body-text">“The bank has never been as profitable as it is today,” Carrazza said at his office in Patriot’s headquarters at 900 Bedford St. in Stamford. “We took an aggressive approach to turning it around and we will continue with that approach.”</p>
<p class="Body-text">Dividends have been coming fast and furious for Patriot over the past several months.</p>
<p class="Body-text">In August, it posted second-quarter pretax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804,000. Those are significant increases over the year-ago quarter’s pretax loss of $948,000 and net loss of $582,000. For the six months ended June 30, net income was $2.5 million, compared with $71,000 for the first half of 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp Inc., the parent of Patriot Bank, posted second quarter pretax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804,000, significant increases over the year-ago quarter’s pretax loss of $948,000 and net loss of $582,000. For the six months ended June 30, net income was $2.5 million, compared with $71,000 for the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>Based in Stamford, the bank has Westchester branches in Scarsdale and Bedford in addition to its Connecticut locations.</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first six months of 2016 and 2017 were affected by a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved. In the first half of 2016, Patriot took significant loan-loss provisions, but aggressively worked toward a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017, according to the bank.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan-loss provision, which primarily included loan losses and related recoveries, the bank’s second-quarter net income was up 42 percent from the first quarter of 2017 and net income for the six-month period ending June 30 was 28 percent higher than the same period in 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot National Bancorp, parent company of Patriot Bank, continued its push into the New Haven County market Wednesday, announcing an agreement to acquire Prime Bank in Orange.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot Bank already has a branch office in Milford. But it is the Stamford-based bank’s only New Haven County location, so the acquisition of Prime Bank, which has only one branch, will increase Patriot Bank’s presence in southwestern New Haven County.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Full terms of the deal were not released, but the acquisition will be paid for in cash, according to Patriot National officials. The deal is subject to approval by Prime’s shareholders and banking regulators.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot National officials said Prime shareholders will receive aggregate cash payment equal to 115 percent of Prime’s tangible book value as of the deal’s closing date, which is expected to occur sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Prime Bank’s tangible book value as of June 30 was approximately $9 million.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">“The acquisition of Prime Bank will support our operating goals of extending Patriot Bank’s footprint, building scale, and improving key operating metrics, all of which ultimately adds value for our shareholders and customers,” Michael Carrazza, Patriot chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Jasper Jaser, Prime’s chief executive officer, said the deal “meets the objectives of our shareholders, customers and employees.” Officials with both banks did not provide information regarding the number of employees that Prime has.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">“Our customers will benefit from increased services and expanded product and lending capabilities,” Jaser said in a statement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">John Carusone, president of the Bank Analysis Center, a Hartford-based industry consulting firm, said the acquisition of Prime continues Patriot Bank’s rise from near financial ruin in 2010.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">It was founded in 1994 by Fred DeCaro Jr., who was a principal in several Westchester County automobile dealerships, according to Carusone. But a series of bad loans that were made to luxury home developers nearly ruined the bank after Connecticut’s market for expensive real estate took a nosedive during the last recession, he said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Carrazza, a former Goldman Sachs executive, stepped in with an investor group and recapitalized Patriot National with $60 million. Then Carrazza and his fellow investors bought out the bank shareholders “for pennies on the dollar,” according to Carusone.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot” or the “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:<a href="https://globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=PNBK&amp;exchange=2">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), and Prime Bank headquartered in Orange, CT (“Prime”) (PMHV:US) jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Patriot will acquire Prime. The acquisition will expand Patriot’s community banking presence and footprint in Southern Connecticut.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $55.8 million in deposits and $27.8 million in total loans.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement Prime shareholders will receive aggregate cash consideration equal to 115% of Prime’s tangible book value as of the closing date. The acquisition will result in a new Patriot branch located in the Town of Orange, in New Haven County.  The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter 2017 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and Prime shareholder approval.</p>
<p><strong>Patriot Chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza</strong> stated<strong>,</strong> “The acquisition of Prime Bank will support our operating goals of extending Patriot Bank’s footprint, building scale, and improving key operating metrics, all of which ultimately adds value for our shareholders and customers.”</p>
<p><strong>Richard Muskus Jr.</strong>, Patriot’s President, added, “The acquisition will enable Patriot Bank to expand its consumer and small business relationships, lending operations, and community presence, while offering Prime’s current customers a broader suite of products.”</p>
<p>In the second fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported pre-tax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804 thousand, or $0.21 per diluted share.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income was $2.5 million or $0.65 per diluted share.  In July 2017, Patriot announced the reinstatement of its dividend policy and declared its first quarterly dividend for shareholders since 2008.</p>
<p>Patriot anticipates that Prime’s branch staff will join Patriot to assist in a seamless transition and continue to help drive growth efforts and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Prime CEO Jasper J. Jaser</strong> stated, “We are pleased to announce this transaction, as we believe merging into Patriot meets the objectives of our shareholders, customers and employees.  Our customers will benefit from increased services and expanded product and lending capabilities; our branch employees will be part of a larger organization and branch network, offering broader career opportunities.”</p>
<p><strong>Paul Lutsky, Prime’s Vice President</strong>, added, “The merger will support Patriot’s growth strategies, allowing it to leverage its larger capital base and legal lending limits to provide broader lending solutions to Prime’s customers.”</p>
<p>Prime Bank shareholders will receive detailed information about the transaction in a proxy statement that will be sent to them in connection with a special shareholders’ meeting to approve the transaction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Patriot&#8221;, &#8220;Bancorp&#8221;) (NASDAQ:<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/pnbk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), today announced another quarter of powerful earnings momentum, reporting second quarter pre-tax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804 thousand, or $0.21 per diluted share.</p>
<p>This compares to net income of $1.7 million, $0.44 per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and a reported loss of $582 thousand for the same quarter a year ago.   For the six months ended June 30, 2017 net income was $2.5 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with $71 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first six months of 2016 and 2017 were affected by a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved.  In the first half of 2016, the Bank took significant loan loss provisions, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision (which primarily included loan losses and recoveries related to this loan), Patriot&#8217;s second quarter net income was up 42% from the first quarter of 2017, and net income for the six-month period ending June 30, 2017 was 28% higher than the same period in 2016.  These results are the by-product of aggressive value-enhancing strategies that have been underway over the past year.</p>
<p>Strong earnings performance is attributable to loan and deposit growth, while operating expenses have remained under tight control.  Compared to a year ago, loans increased 28% while deposits increased 26%, fueling the strong growth in net interest income.</p>
<p><strong>CEO Michael Carrazza stated:</strong> &#8220;This quarter&#8217;s impressive results are directly attributable to the enhancements we have made in management and operations.  We expect this positive trend to continue as we prioritize high-impact strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carrazza took over operational control of Patriot as interim CEO in August 2016 to execute a series of value-enhancing strategies and to reposition the executive team.  The performance in the past four quarters reflects an intensive and carefully planned strategy to drive profitability and shareholder value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initiatives to increase scale, build critical mass in attractive product lines and improve deposit funding channels are primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value,&#8221; added <strong>Mr. Carrazza.</strong></p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, total assets were $773 million, essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter, when they had increased by $18 million.  In the year since June 30, 2016, total assets increased by $121 million, up from $652 million.  Loans totaled $679 million as of June 30, 2017, up 8% from the $631 million reported March 31, 2017, and up 28% from the $529 million reported June 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Deposits remained essentially unchanged during the quarter at $562 million and were up 26% year-over-year as compared with $446 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot&#8217;s overall growth prospects. The loan pipeline remains strong and continued growth is expected.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 14% from the first quarter 2017 and up 17% from the corresponding 2016 period, reflecting strong loan and deposit growth.  Net interest income of $11.8 million in the year-to-date period was 9% higher than the $10.8 million in the six month period ending June 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.61% for the quarter and 3.56% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.50% in the prior quarter and 3.77% in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter was $260 thousand, reflecting the growth in loans with overall credit quality remaining strong.  The year-to-date credit in the provision of $1.5 million reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $2.0 million in both the second quarter and year-to-date periods in 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income was $349 thousand in the quarter, 26% higher than the prior quarter.  The prior quarter includes a loss on the sale of investment securities of $78 thousand.  Year-to-date non-interest income of $626 thousand was 19% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the loss on security sales recognized in the first quarter, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased 7%, over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased 2% over the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017 shareholders&#8217; equity was $65.3 million, an increase of $3.4 million from a year ago.  The Company&#8217;s book value per share increased to $16.77 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $15.64 a year ago.</p>
<p>The Bank&#8217;s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory status.  As of June 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.97%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.73% and total risk based capital was 11.59%.</p>
