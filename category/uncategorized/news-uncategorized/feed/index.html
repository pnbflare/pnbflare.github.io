				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot’s Banking Staff Up 42% in City of Stamford</p>
<p>Patriot Bancorp, N.A. (PNBK) announces that Scott Laughinghouse, a 30 year community banking veteran, has joined to serve in the senior capacity of Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer.</p>
<p>As Chief Lending Officer, he will manage the bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, supervise the lending teams and work to ensure the community bank’s long term profit growth. Mr. Laughinghouse will report to and work directly with the bank’s President, Richard A. Muskus Jr.</p>
<p>He previously served as Chief Lending Officer and Senior Vice President of the First American International Bank in Brooklyn, NY. Before that, he was<br />
Chief Commercial Credit and Lending officer at Lake Sunapee Bank in Newport, NH as well as Senior Lender and Chief Credit Officer at the Saving Bank of Walpole in Keene, NH.</p>
<p>“Scott’s depth and range of experience in lending will bring incredible value to Patriot Bank and our banking teams. His addition will support the continued expansion of Patriot’s market and footprint,” said Mr. Muskus. “Patriot is committed to attracting the best, brightest and most talented financial industry professionals to serve our customers, the communities where we are centered and our shareholders alike. His experience adds even more value to an already strong banking team.”</p>
<p>In the City of Stamford where Patriot is headquartered, the bank has been significantly increasing the number of bankers it employs. That headcount has continued to grow by 42% in the last 18 months from 50 at its 900 Bedford Street headquarters to 71 at the end of 2017.</p>
<p>So far in 2017 Patriot Bank has achieved and surpassed many financial and banking milestones. As of September 30, 2016, total assets increased $144 million (up 21%) to $826 million. Deposits continued to rise and are now up 28% year-over-year at $605 million (up $134 million) with loans totaling $710 million, an increase of 27% from the $560 million reported one year earlier. The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.</p>
<p>In August, Patriot announced its pending acquisition of Prime Bank of Orange, Connecticut. It was announced last week that Prime Bank shareholders voted in favor of its merger with Patriot. As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $56 million in deposits and $28 million in total loans. Closing is pending receipt of regulatory approvals, which is targeted before year-end.</p>
<p>Mr. Laughinghouse earned a Bachelor in Economics from Middlebury College and has served on the board of the West Central Behavioral Health Center in Lebanon, NH, and on the board of YMCA’s Camp Takodah in Richmond, NH, as well as serving as a youth baseball, soccer and basketball coach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Patriot National Bancorp Net Income Breaks $1 Million Milestone </em></strong><strong><em>in the Third Quarter; Declares Quarterly Dividend  </em></strong></p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;  &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><em>Efforts yield significant 26% earnings climb, while assets increase to $826 million. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>CEO says, “We can do even better!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>STAMFORD, CT – October 31, 2017</strong> – Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot”, “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ: PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced another milestone achievement with quarterly pre-tax earnings of $1.7 million and quarterly net income exceeding $1.0 million, or $0.26 per fully diluted share.</p>
<p>The $1 million net income compares to net income of $804 thousand, $0.21 per fully diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017 and $814 thousand, $0.21 per share, for the same quarter a year ago.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 net income was $3.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with $885 thousand, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, for the corresponding 2016 period.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank’s deposits continued to rise and are now up 28% year-over-year, with loan growth of 5% for the quarter and 27% from the year prior, fueling a strong growth in net interest income.   Net interest income climbed 23% from the corresponding 2016 period and for 2017 is 14% higher than in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>In addition to the announcement of quarterly earnings, Patriot announced the declaration of its second consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.01 per fully diluted share.  The correct record date for this quarterly dividend is November 9, 2017, with a dividend payment date of November 10, 2017.</p>
<p>CEO <strong>Michael Carrazza</strong> stated: “This quarter’s milestone is further confirmation of the steady progress we expect to achieve from the operational disciplines put in place and management’s focus on growth and value accretion.  While pleased in reaching these milestones, content we are not.  Internal mandates have been set to materially beat third quarter performance and further enhance key operating metrics in the fourth quarter.  The expected closing of our acquisition of Prime Bank will further add to our earnings momentum.”</p>
<p>Announced last week, Prime Bank shareholders voted in favor of its merger with Patriot. As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $56 million in deposits and $28 million in total loans.  Closing is pending receipt of regulatory approvals, which is targeted before year-end.</p>
<p>Richard Muskus, Patriot’s President added, “We have created greater capacity to build a high quality loan portfolio, achieve critical mass in attractive product lines and enhance service offerings to our customers.  These are the primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value.”</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first nine months of 2016 and 2017 include the impact of a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Bank recorded a significant loan loss provision, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision, which primarily consisted of losses and recoveries related to this loan, net income for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2017 was 30% higher than the same period in 2016.  These results are the by-product of aggressive value-enhancing strategies that have been underway over the past year.</p>
<p>The strong earnings performance is attributable to significant loan growth, while operating expenses have remained under tight control.</p>
<p>In the year since September 30, 2016, total assets increased by $144 million (21%), up from $682 million.  Loans totaled $710 million as of September 30, 2017, up 5% from the $679 million reported June 30, 2017, and up 27% from the $560 million reported September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Deposits increased during the quarter to $605 million and were up 28% year-over-year as compared with $471 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot’s overall growth prospects.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $7.1 million in the quarter, up 12% from the second quarter 2017 and up 23% from the corresponding 2016 period.  Net interest income of $18.9 million in the year-to-date period was 14% higher than the $16.5 million in the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.65% for the quarter and 3.59% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.61 % in the prior quarter and 3.79% in the first nine months of 2016.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter was $545 thousand, reflecting the growth in loans with overall credit quality remaining strong.  The year-to-date credit in the provision of $944 thousand reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $355 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income was $386 thousand in the quarter, 10% higher than the prior quarter.  Year-to-date non-interest income of $1 million was 15% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the loss on security sales of $78 thousand recognized in the first quarter, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased 4%, over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased 7% over the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2017 shareholders’ equity was $66.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million from a year ago.  The Company’s book value per share increased to $17.02 at September 30, 2017 as compared to $15.80 a year ago.</p>
<p>The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  As of September 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.57%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.69% and total risk based capital was 11.55%.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Dec. 14 – the second such increase in a year and only the second, too, since December 2008 – drew mixed reactions nationwide from banking and economic experts. Many saw it as an encouraging sign of an ongoing, if slow, national economic recovery, while others viewed it as possibly lessening both banks’ profitability and consumers’ interest in and ability to afford loans.</p>
<p>But Connecticut area banks, which collectively were on pace to post strong results for 2016, maintain that the Dec. 14 rate increase – from a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent to a range of 0.5 to 0.75 percent – is small enough to not have an adverse effect. Further, they said that expected additional increases this year – likely two or three – should not noticeably dampen business.</p>
<p>Fairfield County bankers said they are most concerned about the small business segment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rick_Muskus_032ret.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2376 alignnone" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rick_Muskus_032ret-215x300.jpg" alt="rick_muskus_032ret" width="215" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><small><small>Rick Muskus, Patriot Bank Chief Lending Officer</small></small></span></p>
<p>At Patriot Bank in Stamford, Richard A. Muskus, executive vice president and chief lending officer, noted that if debt services rise incrementally for small businesses, “They will have to make changes to their business model and business planning. Additional rate increases could limit their cash flow to the point where they may not be able to hire that additional person or be in a position to borrow money for equipment or another store.”</p>
<p>“Should a small business owner be expanding or contracting in this environment? Only the individual business owner knows for sure,” Muskus said. Taking on additional employees or equipment without the ability to turn it into revenue right away can be especially concerning in light of interest rate hikes, he said.</p>
<p>Muskus said that Patriot is “executing well” on the 21 percent of its overall business that comes via small business loans; he’d noted earlier that historically just 11 percent of the bank’s business comes from that sector. He added that one of the bank’s “target goals” is to become an approved U.S. Small Business Administration lender in the first quarter of this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small business loans have notably increased in Fairfield County this year, with area banks saying they expect the trend to continue into 2017.</p>
<p>Rick Muskus, executive vice president and chief lending officer at Patriot Bank in Stamford, said that historically 11 percent of Patriot’s business has come via small business loans. “But as of today we have 21 percent in the pipeline that fits the small business category,” he said. “For the past few months, we’ve seen a lot of people starting new businesses or purchasing an existing business due to aging ownership or for other reasons.” That trend has been particularly noticeable in the restaurant and liquor store business, he said.</p>
<p>Still, Muskus noted that the county “is not an inexpensive market to start businesses in. They need a solid banking partner, and we’re actively working to improve and expand our presence in the sector. We’re working with our branch and assistant branch managers all the way down to our tellers to learn more about our small business loan program, not just to discuss with customers but also so they can talk knowledgably about it in their non-professional life.” He said that up to 80 percent of Patriot’s business comes from word of mouth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the windows of their headquarters at 900 Bedford St., Patriot Bank executives can watch a major capital investment take shape.</p>
<p>Construction started earlier this month at 999 Bedford St. on an approximately 8,700-square-foot building to house Patriot’s new flagship branch and a banking center for its staff who service the bank’s video ATMs. Costing about $3.5 million to acquire and build on a site formerly occupied by a Key Bank branch, the new complex will allow the firm to base all its corporate staff in Stamford.</p>
<p>“While we think of all the big-company names, Stamford is actually largely driven by local businesses,” said <a href="http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22Frederick+Staudmyer%22">Frederick Staudmyer</a>, Patriot Bank’s executive vice president and chief administrative officer. “Those are our customers. We want to be where our customer base is. We see ourselves very much as a connector in our communities.”</p>
<p>The new branch and banking center is scheduled to open in late December. It will include some 30 employees, including 15 who will communicate with customers who use Patriot’s video ATMs. Launched last December at Patriot’s Darien branch, the bank is rolling out the live-banking technology to its other properties, including the flagship branch.</p>
<p>The acquisition of the two properties on Bedford Street fits into the bank’s strategy of buying as many of their properties as they can. Patriot now owns half of its branches. “We’re investing significant dollars in the facilities to be able to provide better services,” said CEO and President <a href="http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22Kenneth+Neilson%22">Kenneth Neilson</a>. “If we’re going to be investing that much, we may as well own the facilities.”</p>
<p>In an era when customers can do much of their banking on their phones, Patriot executives said that brick-and-mortar establishments remain a vital part of their business. The branches include a number of amenities aimed at linking customers with bankers and other customers. Its new branches feature video-conferencing technology available to clients.</p>
<p>“We consider ourselves partners with our customers,” Neilson said. “We want to help them grow their business and then we think we need locations where we can sit and talk to people.”</p>

<p class="wpb_wrapper">In 1987, Susan Neilson was working for Chemical Bank, which had just acquired Texas Commerce Bank (TCB). She was asked to move to Texas and integrate all 80 of TCB’s independent branches across the state. She traveled from Houston to Dallas to Amarillo to El Paso, and everywhere in between, convincing TCB leaders to change, and overhauled not only the banks’ cultures, but also their processes. “The idea of selling and convincing … teams <span class="s1">across such a diverse state … was an experience with lessons learned that have helped me in every </span>aspect of my career,” says Neilson.</p>
<p class="p6"><strong><span class="s2">Quick Tip: </span><span class="s1">“By maintaining a strong presence in the community … we are able to understand our customers’ needs.”</span></strong></p>
<p class="p6">Today, as COO of Patriot Bank, N.A., Neilson is still focused on creating culture. Because Patriot Bank is a community-based organization, building relationships and fostering the idea of serving the community is at the heart of Neilson’s duties. “Our clients see us as neighbors, and that helps us collaborate with them to tackle the unique challenges they face,” says Neilson. “We are accessible, nimble and forward-looking, and those are the values I am proud to instill in our employees every day.”</p>
<p class="p6">Patriot Bank’s mission is to “show by doing.” That’s why it has a strong commitment to giving back. The bank has donated time, money and goods to numerous local charities, including the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Northern Westchester. In addition, Patriot Bank recently sponsored an event for nonprofit leaders, giving different organizations the opportunity to learn from each other and connect.</p>
