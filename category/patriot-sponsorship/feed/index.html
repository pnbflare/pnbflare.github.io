<p>Patriot Bank is a proud supporter of the third annual Jamaican Jam fundraiser held at the Riverside Yacht Club on June 10. More than 200 guests, double the amount of last year’s event, attended.</p>
<p>The Jamaica Bobsleigh Federation event raised funds for the Caribbean island’s bobsled team, as they prepare for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Six Jamaican members of the men’s and women’s Olympic teams were in attendance, along with their bobsled.</p>
<p>“Patriot Bank is delighted to support the Jamaica Bobsleigh Federation in reaching their goals to once again compete in the Winter Olympics,” said <strong>Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus Jr.</strong></p>
<p><center><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2584 aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3-1.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="452" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3-1.jpg 339w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /></a></center></p>
<p>Master of Ceremonies was Devon Harris, a writer, motivational speaker, and one of four members on Jamaica’s first men’s bobsled team in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta. The story was made famous by the Disney movie <em>Cool Runnings </em>starring comedian John Candy as the Jamaican team’s coach<strong><em>. </em>Mr. Harris</strong> recently joked with the <em>Greenwich Time</em>, “How ridiculous is it that Jamaica has a bobsled team?”</p>
<p><center><br />
<a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2580 aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-1.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="286" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-1.jpg 448w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-1-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></a></center></p>
<p>“The sum of my experience before competing in the Olympics was maybe 13 weeks of practice total and we then competed against guys who had been doing this for 13 years,” said <strong>Harris</strong>.</p>
<p>The fundraising event was organized by Mr. Harris and Louis Van Leeuwen, owner and CEO of Greenwich Construction and Curry &amp; Kingston. Mr. Van Leeuwen was born in Jamaica, where his family escaped from Nazis via the French underground in the 1940s.</p>
<p>The 2018 Winter Olympics will allow up to 170 bobsledders compete. Spots will be awarded on January 14, 2018, based on the International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation (IBSF) Ranking List.</p>

<p>Future 5, a nonprofit dedicated to helping low income high school students in Stamford graduate and connect to a better and sustainable education and career path, hosted a special recognition event to celebrate the graduation of their high school seniors at the Ferguson Library.</p>
<p>A total of 53 Future 5 seniors graduated, representing all three Stamford high schools – Westhill High School, Stamford High School, and AITE. Future 5’s class of 2017 is their eighth graduating class and includes 29 students committed to four-year schools including Denison University, Fairfield University, UCONN Storrs, Southern CT State University, Central CT State University, Tuskegee University, Virginia State University, and many others.</p>
<p>Seventeen plan to attend two-year colleges including Norwalk Community College. One student will enter the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Future 5 member Smelanda Jean Baptiste, a senior at Stamford High School, is one example of the many students who have found success through the organization. She will be attending Denison University in Granville, Ohio on a full scholarship and intends to major in Anthropology/Sociology and Computer Science. She will be the first in her family to receive a college degree, like many other past and present graduates of the Future 5 organization.</p>

Our students continue to break barriers and become productive members of communities,” said Nancy Roath, co-director, college prep at Future 5.</p>
<p>“The Class of 2017 is filled with wonderful students who have worked hard to realize their dream of attending college. It has been such a joy to work with this great group of students on their post high school plans. We are excited to see what the Class of 2017 will accomplish over the years and the many positive ways they will change the world,” said Debbie Eagan, co-director, college prep at Future 5.</p>
<p>During the graduation event, founder and Executive Director Clif McFeely spoke along with distinguished Future 5 alumni and members of the graduating senior class.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank, XL Catlin, and the New Canaan Artisans were the event sponsors whose donations covered the catering for the event as well as the purchase of a college T-shirt for each graduate attending college in the fall and a $50 gift card to purchase college necessities.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, Future 5 has served over 500 students and has a 98 percent high school graduation rate. For the 2016-2017 school year, Future 5 served approximately 116 high school students. In addition to the staff, 70-plus coaches and volunteers commit to over 60,000 hours helping Stamford’s high school students.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Disabled American Veterans – Chapter 13’s Al Meadows receives a check from  Patriot Bank, N.A., President Richard Muskus Jr. for Operation Gift Cards</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 200 anglers, including disabled veterans, and their families competed in the Halloween Yacht Club’s sixth annual Hooks for Heroes fishing tournament in Stamford to raise money for severely injured members of the U.S. Military and their families stationed at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Hospital.</p>
<p>100% of all entry fees, sponsorships and proceeds benefit the Stamford Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Chapter 13’s Operation Gift Card project, which provides gift cards to Walter Reed patients and their families. Patriot presented the organization with a $1,000 donation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2555 size-medium" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2-224x300.jpg 224w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.jpg 377w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">A fisherman weighs his catch of the day</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Stamford is the birthplace of Hooks for Heroes, a great event that brings our community together to support disabled veterans who have put America first,” said <strong>Richard Muskus Jr., Patriot Bank President</strong>. “Patriot Bank deeply and wholeheartedly supports America’s veterans and is incredibly honored to give back and support this local tournament.”</p>
<p>This year, with the support of Patriot Bank, more wounded veterans than in prior years will be able to make the trip from Walter Reed Military Hospital in Bethesda, MD to deliver the gift cards.</p>

<p>Over 200 fishermen, disabled military veterans and their families will participate in the 6<sup>th</sup> annual Halloween Yacht Club Hooks for Heroes Fishing Tournament, sponsored by Patriot Bank N.A.</p>

<p>100% of all entry fees, sponsorships and donations will support the Disabled American Veterans Stamford Chapter 13’s <strong>Operation Gift Card</strong> project, which benefits patients and their families at Walter Reed National Military Medical Hospital.</p>
<p>The military men and women use these gift cards to buy items for their families from the Post Exchange.</p>
<p>“Stamford is the birthplace of Hooks for Heroes, a great event that brings our community together to support disabled veterans who have put America first,” said <strong>Richard Muskus Jr., Patriot Bank President.</strong> “Patriot Bank deeply and wholeheartedly supports America’s veterans and is incredibly honored to give back and support this local tournament.”</p>
<p>This year, with the support of Patriot Bank, more wounded veterans than in prior years will be able to make the trip from Walter Reed Military Hospital in Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>Tournament participants will compete in two different fishing categories: largest bluefish and largest bass, both by weight. Local veterans, as well as patients on leave from Walter Reed, accompanied by their families will participate.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The event was sponsored by Patriot Bank and is part of an ongoing series providing an exclusive, up-close and personal look at the challenges and opportunities that top CEOs in the region confront.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Broadie also discussed the new expansion construction underway, which adds 46,000 square feet to HCC’s Lafayette Hall on downtown Bridgeport’s Lafayette Blvd. and is expected to be completed in March 2017.

<h5 style="text-align: center;">(Left to right): Patriot Bank President and CEO Kenneth Neilson, Al’s Angels Founder Al DiGuido and Westport Library Executive Director Bill Harmer</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local digital marketing entrepreneur and Al’s Angels Founder Al DiGuido recently offered insights and fielded questions from a variety of business leaders on the key strategies for building and leading successful businesses, as part of the Westport Library’s “Insight from Entrepreneurs” series.</p>
<p>Some 80 participants learned essential truths about what it takes to achieve success in a wide variety of business ventures during the interactive discussion, sponsored by Patriot Bank, N.A. and Bernstein Global Wealth Management.</p>
<p>“Patriot Bank is proud to support events like Westport Library’s ‘Insights from Entrepreneurs’, which makes CEO thought leadership accessible to current and aspiring business leaders,” said <strong>Kenneth Neilson, Patriot Bank President and CEO. </strong>“Mr. DiGuido offered his wisdom from many years as an entrepreneur, incorporating his principles for courage, passion, high energy and tremendous generosity into all of his endeavors.”</p>
<p>The discussion included key insights into identifying marketplace trends, leveraging technology to generate sales and profits, enhancing ROI performance, acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers. Mr. DiGuido also discussed his no-nonsense, direct and tactical approach to converting dreams into reality.</p>
<p>Mr. DiGuido is the founder of the Bridgeport-based nonprofit Al’s Angels, which provides moments of joy and comfort, as well as lifesaving medical treatment, to more than 9,000 children and families challenged by cancers, rare blood diseases, domestic violence and financial hardships. He is also CEO of Zeta Interactive, where he evolved the email business into a fully integrated technology platform, services and strategies operation.</p>
<p>“Much of success in business and achieving our goals and objectives is about winning small battles. If we try to take on the world as our first step&#8230;we can become distracted and disillusioned,” said <strong>Mr. DiGuido. </strong>“It was great to provide some focus to those who attended the seminar on the importance of understanding and obsessing over a customer&#8217;s need so as to provide products and services that truly satisfy that need. When we connect customer needs with our solution and market the unique selling proposition of our solution&#8230;we are focused in the right place to build something special.”</p>
<p>The entrepreneur has built an award-winning digital media and direct marketing career with successful businesses in publishing, digital media, non-profit and retail. Mr. DiGuido is known for his expertise in how evolving media platforms drive brand success in today’s economy.</p>
<p>“It is such a pleasure to be a part of a great collaborative effort with Patriot Bank and Bernstein Global Wealth Management to bring exceptional business leaders like Al DiGuido, with his global reach and local roots, to share insights with the community of Westport. It demonstrates the amazing talent that exists in our community and the generosity of experts in so many fields who come to the library and offer their wealth of experience each day,” said <strong>Westport Library Executive Director Bill Harmer.</strong></p>
<p>Past speakers of the “Insight from Entrepreneurs” series have included Rick Smilow, president and owner of The Institute of Culinary Education; Doug Bernstein, Westport resident and co-founder of <a href="http://www.melissaanddoug.com/">Melissa &amp; Doug®</a> toy company; and Joseph Zaffe, co-author of <em>Z.E.R.O.: Zero Paid Media as the New Marketing Model.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three cheers for the red, white and blue!</p>
<p>Bring your friends and family to Fairfield’s historic Town Green on Sunday, July 10, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to celebrate a special display of the Declaration of Independence at the Fairfield Museum’s Declaration Celebration. Pack a picnic or sample from local food trucks as you enjoy crafts, games, a British encampment, walking tours and family fun.</p>
<p>View a real British encampment that will simulate what Fairfield looked like when the Redcoats invaded. Experience life during the Revolutionary War by visiting with members of the 54th CT Regiment of Foot, a British regiment like the ones who invaded Fairfield in 1779. The members of the 54th will set up a British soldier’s encampment, explaining the equipment that was likely used during the British invasion of Fairfield as well as demonstrating the manual of arms. There might also be a need to proclaim the “King’s will” to those in attendance while being part of the force occupying the town for the day!</p>
<p>In addition, Burning of Fairfield Walking Tours are also being offered on July 10, every half hour 12:30-2 p.m. Stroll back in time while exploring the history and events surrounding the attack on Fairfield by the British on July 7-8, 1779. Pre-registration is required. Adults: $10; Students: $5. Sign up at <a href="https://2016burningfairfieldwalkingtours.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">https://2016burningfairfieldwalkingtours.eventbrite.com</a>.</p>
<p>In honor of the 240th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, visitors are invited to a view an early version of the Declaration of Independence, which will be on display July 1-17. The document on display is a print from a copperplate engraving that John Quincy Adams (as Secretary of State) commissioned when he realized the original Declaration was deteriorating from frequent use. Completed in 1823, it is the best representation of what the document looked like before the signatures began to fade. This version of the Declaration is one of six known copies printed on heavy paper, with the first edition imprint on top, and is loaned to the Museum by Seth Kaller, Inc. Other historic items will also be on display, including Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the journals of Congress in 1776, documents from Connecticut signers of the Declaration, and later items that reflect its legacy.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence display is sponsored by Patriot Bank. &#8220;Since the colonial era, Connecticut and its leaders have played a critical role in the founding and success of our nation,” <strong>said Kenneth Neilson, </strong>President<strong> and CEO at Patriot Bank, N.A.</strong> “Nearly 250 years ago the Patriots who founded and fought for America’s independence lived and worked right here in Fairfield County. Today we not only recognize but seek to emulate the role models they were in shaping the democracy that is the United States. It is a great honor for Patriot bank to support and sponsor the Fairfield Museum and History Center’s public display of our nation’s historic Declaration of Independence.”</p>

<p>
<p>Sacred Heart University President Dr. John Petillo recently offered an inside look at the Fairfield-based Catholic university’s rich background, history and positive economic impact on the region, as the featured speaker at the Bridgeport Regional Business Council (BRBC)’s “Inside the CEO’s Office” series.</p>
<p>More than 40 local business leaders gathered at Sacred Heart’s Martire Center on June 2 to learn from Dr. Petillo how the university has evolved from a commuter school to a full university and regional institution with over 8,000 students and 900 faculty members in just a number of years.</p>
<p>Dr. Petillo explained the enormous direct economic impact that Sacred Heart has, employing more than 5,000 full-time workers (1,426 direct jobs and 3,676 indirect jobs) and paying over $69 million in wages, salaries and benefits, as of Fiscal Year 2013. The university also spends over $55 million on goods and services, $143 million for capital improvements of buildings and structures (5-year average), and generates nearly $40 million additionally from visitors and students, all making a significant impact on the regional economy.</p>
<p>The event was sponsored by Patriot Bank and Energize Connecticut, and is part of an ongoing series providing an exclusive, up-close and personal look at the challenges and opportunities that top CEOs  in the region confront. The BRBC’s mission is to pursue economic development in the region that will lead to more jobs and an increased tax base.</p>
<p>“Bridgeport Regional Business Council’s ‘Inside the CEO’s Office’ series is an excellent way for local business leaders to connect with and learn from the experiences of some of Connecticut’s top leaders,” said <strong>Kenneth Neilson, Patriot Bank President &amp; CEO. </strong>“Patriot Bank recognizes the importance of spotlighitng how Sacred Heart University is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of its growing campus, population and staff, and is a significant and growing economic force for Connecticut.”</p>
<p>“It was an honor to be asked to participate in the Inside the CEO’s Office program,” said <strong>Sacred Heart University President John J. Petillo.</strong> “We enjoyed the opportunity to welcome the area’s business leaders to our new Martire Center for Business &amp; Communications and to share the exciting things that are happening here at Sacred Heart.”</p>
<p>Sacred Heart recently opened the 120,000-square-foot Frank and Marisa Martire Business &amp; Communications Center on campus and is currently building the 117,000-square-foot Center for Healthcare Education, spending nearly $100 million combined on these two projects. This fall, it will open the Jorge Bergoglio Hall to house over 200 students.</p>
<p>The BRBC comprises the Bridgeport, Stratford and Trumbull Chambers of Commerce, Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation, Leadership Greater Bridgeport and the Women’s Leadership Council and has approximately 1,000 members.</p>
