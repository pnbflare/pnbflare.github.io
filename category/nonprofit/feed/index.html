				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus Jr. speaks on the importance of government funding for nonprofits, as well as Patriot&#8217;s ongoing support of the sector.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state budget impasse is already being felt by a number of sectors, but perhaps none as much as the nonprofit segment.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a horrible situation,” said Eileen Healy, executive director of Independence Northwest. One of the state’s five Centers for Independent Living, the Naugatuck-based advocacy program for the disabled already reduced its catchment area from 44 towns to about 10 last year, with further reductions possibly on the way.</p>
<p>“At this point we’re pretty much limited to the greater Waterbury area,” Healy said. “We would love to keep serving places like Newtown, Bethel and Danbury as we have in the past. If someone comes to us we’ll help them, but we can no longer go to them.”</p>
<p>Since 1988, the five centers had served all 169 of the state’s towns and cities but with last year’s reduction in state funding, from nearly $529,000 to about $202,000, they now serve only 25, including Bridgeport, Stratford and Trumbull in Fairfield County.</p>
<p>Independence Northwest slashed salaries throughout the organization last year but is maintaining its staff of 11 full-time and four part-time employees.</p>
<p>Funds for the five centers will likely take another hit when a budget is passed, Healy added, with Republicans budgeting $372,000 and Democrats proposing $250,000. “We’ve planned for the worst and budgeted accordingly,” she said. If funding is cut, “A couple of positions will probably be reduced to part time and we may have layoffs.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know when the funds are coming, but we’re still supposed to do the work,” Healy said. “Some nonprofits have been told to cease services, but we have not — at least not at this point.”</p>
<p>Twenty-six nonprofit providers that contract with the state Department of Social Services were informed the would no longer receive funding as of the close of business on July 1, with some funding provided through Aug. 1 to help them transition to the new reality. Those included programs offered by the Greater Bridgeport Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program; Person-to-Person Inc., a Darien-based provider of basic needs and services to the underprivileged; Career Resources Inc. and Families in Crisis Inc., both of Bridgeport; and the Community Action Agency of Western Connecticut Inc. in Danbury.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Connecticut Community Nonprofit Alliance as the July 1 budget deadline approached painted a similar gloomy picture. In answer to how they would plan for a reduced level of funding, 82 percent of Alliance members said they would be forced to lay off staff; 77 percent that they would need to reduce services or programs; 60 percent that they would eliminate programs entirely; 57 percent would reduce service hours; and 45 percent would stop accepting new clients.</p>
<p>“We know that if things don’t change, thousands of Connecticut residents will go without the care they need,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the nonprofit alliance. “Depending on how long the situation goes on, there may be some places that will be forced to shut down.”</p>
<p>The alliance has proposed to lawmakers a plan it says would save approximately $300 million over two years by shifting more services from more expensive state government agencies into the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p>As an example, the alliance said that the cost for group homes serving the developmentally disabled is $152,000 per person. If half of the 888 people still in state care are shifted to nonprofits, the state would realize a gain of almost $100 million over the next two years.</p>
<p>Casa noted that the change would not be a new one, as more than 86 percent of people receiving state services for developmental disabilities are getting them through community-based nonprofits.</p>
<p>“By supporting the more expensive status quo over new ways to deliver services, the state chooses to deprive people of care they need,” he wrote on the alliance’s website. “There are more than 2,000 people on the waiting list at the Department of Developmental Services and they may never receive services if we maintain the current inefficient and expensive service delivery system.”</p>
<p>Robert Francis, executive director of Regional Youth Adult Social Action Partnership in Bridgeport and an alliance board member, endorses the Casa proposal, especially as his organization is already facing a number of cuts. State funding makes up about $800,000 of its $2.4 million annual budget, Francis said.</p>
<p>While the Department of Children and Families has maintained its funding, money from the Department of Mental Health &amp; Addiction Services and the Judicial Department remain in limbo. As a result, the partnership has already laid off two members of its Street Gang program and instituted a one-day furlough for its remaining 17 full-time and seven part-time employees, who are required to take off one day every two weeks.</p>
<p>Noting that to date Bridgeport this year has already seen 17 homicides, Francis said those numbers “are always higher from June to September. This is the worst possible time to pull our (anti-gang violence) guys off the street.”</p>
<p>Martin Schwartz, president and CEO of The Kennedy Center in Trumbull, said that two of his organization’s key funders have already promised cutbacks. The Department of Social Services announced a 10 percent cut across the board, which will include six furlough days during which the state will not reimburse programs serving people with disabilities; the first will be on July 26.</p>
<p>“We will be closed on those days,” said Schwartz. “But we still have our own expenses and overhead.” Noting that many of Kennedy’s 750 employees make $12 an hour, “Going a day without pay is a pretty difficult thing to do,” he said,</p>
<p>Schwartz said each furlough day would cost the organization about $55,000. “And that’s on top of the cuts we’ve already made over the past several years,” he added, which included laying off about 50 workers.</p>
<p>In addition, cuts by the Department of Rehabilitation Services will result in the layoffs of nine Kennedy Center employees who work with the visually impaired if no budget is in place by July 31.</p>
<p>“I’ve been here for 39 years,” Schwartz said, “and I’ve never seen anything like this. I always thought that one of the primary purposes of a society is to take care of its most vulnerable people, but that’s not the case in Connecticut right now.”</p>
<p>In Bridgeport, The Center for Family Justice President and CEO Debra Greenwood said her organization has been ramping up fundraising efforts through events and appeals to corporations and individuals over the past year in the face of declining state support. The Center laid off five employees, four of them full time, last fall but is hoping to hold on to its 41 remaining staffers.</p>
<p>As its staff has dwindled, its workload has increased, Greenwood said. Its safe house for victims of domestic violence is at 125 percent capacity. By combining services with other nonprofits, the Center is maintaining its level of service for now, she said.</p>
<p>“The big question is, if we and other nonprofits don’t do the work, who will? It won’t be the municipalities. They might be able to for a short period of time, but you need experts to do this kind of work.”</p>
<p>The Bridgeport Public Education Fund Inc., whose services include college access programs, has “never wanted money from the state or the feds — it’s too onerous a process,” said Executive Director Marge Hiller.</p>
<p>Even so, the organization has continued to struggle financially as the purse strings of corporate and individual donors have tightened over the past few years. Although it ended 2016 in the black after posting the first deficit in its 34-year-history in 2015, that was only accomplished by laying off one employee and cutting back on some services, including reducing its two-day college prep workshop to one day. “We’re pretty lean to begin with, so there are not a lot of places to cut,” Hiller said.</p>
<p>Even so, the $10,000 donations it used to get are now usually more in the $5,000 range, she said, adding that unless things dramatically improve, the nonprofit will undergo “a total restructuring” next year.</p>
<p>One reliable source of nongovernmental funding has traditionally been banks, but even they have refocused their priorities. Hiller said that the likes of Citibank, Bank of America and Chase have been redirecting their resources toward community development. The First Niagara Bank Foundation said it would end its funding by 2020 following its 2016 merger with KeyBank, Hiller said.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Muskus Jr., president of Patriot National Bancorp Inc., said that while Stamford-based Patriot Bank will continue to provide support to nonprofits, especially in the education and community development areas, it is incumbent upon the state to supply most of the necessary funds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The landscape for nonprofits throughout the state of Connecticut is certainly stressed at this point,” he said. “A lot of nonprofits are going to have to reinvent themselves to some degree, which could include shedding some assets. Our hope is that once the state sorts things out, the money will flow down and stabilize those organizations.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The state government, legislators and the governor alike, are being very short-sighted. If these service organizations go out of business, the state will have to pick up those services and their costs, which means the taxpayer will have to pay so much more. And if we need to lay off staff, those people are no longer paying income tax,” Muskus said.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s where future pro hockey players and Olympians first laced up, and where countless others happily glided across chilly afternoons on a sheet of ice in central Greenwich.</p>
<p>Now, the Greenwich Skating Club, founded in 1954, has skated into the 21st century. With a multi-million-dollar reconstruction of its rink and clubhouse on Cardinal Road, it is looking to become a greater focal point for the community.</p>
<p>“Many people don’t even know the rink exists,” said General Manager Brent Brower. “We’re trying to open ourselves up to the public more, and get people involved in our club. It’s a great place.”</p>
<p>A number of top athletes have been developed there. Cam Atkinson, a right winger for the Columbus Blue Jackets, who recently earned All-Star honors in the National Hockey League, laced up his skates as a “Squirt” at the club. His father was a coach.</p>
<p>Helen Resor, who played hockey for Yale and won the Bronze medal with the U.S. women’s Olympic team in 2006, has also been a coach at the club. It has incubated talent for the National Women’s Hockey League, such as Bray Ketchum, another Yalie now playing for the New York Riveters, and Shannon Doyle of the CT Whale — also a coach for the club.</p>
<p>Leaders are aiming to build on that success. “We’ve really built out the girls hockey program in the last seven or eight years, and that has grown tremendously. We’re looking to continue to energize that,” said club president Don Raftery.</p>
<p>“It truly is a family-oriented club, with a goal of being a place where people can come to gather and enjoy outdoor sports in the winter,” Raftery said. “That’s been the premises of the club from the beginning, and we’ve tried to continue that tradition.”</p>
<p>The club has increased community outreach, holding a free event for younger girls last month, in addition to free events for local pre-schools.</p>
<p>“We just keep reaching out to different groups. Our goal is to involve as many people as we can in the joys of skating, and to get them hooked early,” said Brower. “Many people say we’re a hidden little gem.”</p>
<p>One goal is to draw skaters from every income level in town. “Greenwich Skating Club is not meant to be something fancy or ostentatious. It’s family-oriented and inviting,” noted Raftery.</p>
<p>The new facility, completed in November, boasts a number of upgrades. The new lighting system is more energy-efficient and does not cast as much as light onto the surrounding residential area. The sound system, likewise, is less obtrusive. The upstairs lounge has wood paneling that channels an Alpine theme, and there are good viewing positions on two adjoining balconies to watch action on the ice.</p>
<p>“It’s a really nice place to watch a game,” says Brower. “The old clubhouse had nostalgia, but it was out of date. This is really state of the art, and people are really happy with it.”</p>
<p>Becky Gutman, a Greenwich mom whose kids skate there, gave her vote of approval on a recent afternoon. “It looks amazing, and they were so thoughtful of what they put in. They thought of everything,” she said.</p>
<p>The club has been planning the upgrades for years, and it initiated a capital campaign and fund-raising drive to create the new facility. Patriot Bank, headquartered in Stamford, generated a $3.1 million loan. Will Farriss, who grew up skating at the rink, is a lending officer at the bank. He said he wished every project the bank worked with achieved the same results.</p>
<p>“They indicated it would be on a fast track — and they exceeded that. I’ve never seen a project, that had such great results, take place so quickly. And under-budget and on-time,” said Farriss.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stamford Academy high school students recently gained career insights from Fairfield County business and community leaders during its 5th Annual Career Conversation. Dozens of students, from grades nine through 12, rotated classrooms for 30-minute conversations about finding, beginning, keeping and advancing in a job.</p>
<div id="attachment_2345" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2345" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-300x183.jpg" alt="Patriot bankers with Stamford Academy students at the 5th Annual Career Conversation " width="300" height="183" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-300x183.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-768x467.jpg 768w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-1024x623.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #003366;"><small>Patriot bankers with Stamford Academy students at the 5th Annual Career Conversation<br />Photo credit: Samantha Latulippe</small></span></p></div>
<p>Students were encouraged to consider how their knowledge and interests could develop a career path. Volunteers offered personal experiences to suggest best approaches to skill-building, educational or vocational training, and job searching.</p>
<p>Fairfield County-based Patriot Bank, N.A. was among the volunteers that participated in this event as part of its continuous efforts to serve the communities its bankers live and work in. Other volunteers included Stamford Police, Stamford Firefighters, local attorneys, entrepreneurs, social service workers and community organization leaders.</p>
<p>The event was held at Stamford Academy, the second charter school opened by Domus, a non-profit that serves more than 1,100 youth in Stamford and New Haven, CT. Stamford Academy opened in 2004 for students who struggled in traditional school environments or had dropped out of school. Its intensive academic program allows students to catch up on instruction in preparation for post-secondary education or training upon graduation.</p>
<p>“I believe this conversation format allows for extremely unique and organic conversations. When I was walking in and out of classrooms, each conversation was very different from the others because the volunteers tailor them to the group of students in front of them,” said Stamford Academy Principal Andrea Weller. “This year we were lucky to have a wide range of volunteers from all different walks of life. The great commonality they shared was their high level of care for our students. This was evident through the content of the conversations and the fact that the conversations overflowed into lunch time.”</p>

<p>“This year we were able to increase the demographic and employment diversity of the volunteers making it the most interactive, engaging, and meaningful conversation yet. It was wonderful to see four Patriot Bank employees join forces with the 34 other volunteers to talk with Stamford Academy Charter High School students about their hopes, dreams, and plans for the future,” said Julia Wade, DOMUS Director of Volunteers.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly inspiring to meet with Stamford Academy students and learn how they are incorporating their interests and skills into their career plans. I’m glad our business and community leaders were able to pass on morsels of knowledge that have been instrumental to their success. These students’ interest and willingness to start building their careers now is a great sign for Stamford’s next generation workforce,” said Joshua Brown, an Assistant Vice President at Patriot Bank.</p>
<p>Patriot bankers Judith Corprew, Robert Hojnacki, Carolyn Wilder and Joshua Brown were among those who discussed how they arrived at their career paths and the steps they took to achieve their aspirations. They spoke about the importance of defining goals, pursuing education and internships, and how to explore job prospects.</p>
<p>Volunteers had lunch with the students following the classroom sessions to continue the dialogue in an open, informal setting.</p>

<p>According to the federal Housing and Urban Development<a href="http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2016/02-2016/Gov__Malloy_Announces_Connecticut_Receives_Federal_Certification_of_Effectively_Eliminating_Veteran_Homelessness/"><sup>1</sup></a>, Connecticut is the second state to end veteran homelessness and is close to being the first state to end chronic homelessness, making it crucial that these impacted individuals acquire financial skills to build a more secure future.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, Patriot Bank, N.A. is providing complimentary financial literacy and counseling to veterans and others who receive help from Homes with Hope, a Westport-based non-profit providing shelter, permanent supportive housing, food and case management.</p>
<p>At Patriot’s 2<sup>nd</sup> annual event at Homes with Hope, over a dozen participants learned about managing money, credit and budgeting basics and began to create a viable plan to begin securing their financial futures. Topics included how to create a budget, open a bank account, establish short- and long-term savings plans, and establish and maintain credit.</p>
<p>The seminar was presented by 16-year banking industry veteran Monique Mason, Assistant Branch Manager at Patriot Bank in Westport.</p>
<p>“There are so many individuals who fall and remain victims to the vicious cycle of homelessness in part because they were never taught basic financial literacy,” said <strong>Ms. Mason.</strong> “Too often, their situation is exacerbated by taking out cash advances or payday loans, which come with high fees and exorbitant interest rates. Patriot bankers are working with some of these veterans and others to take steps to improve their own financial situations, beginning with opening a checking account without fees and considering credit card options towards eventually establishing better credit.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The plight of the nonprofit organization in Fairfield County, rarely in fine fettle to start with, seems to be growing darker, with major challenges posed by increasing competition for ever-shrinking donations and a general reticence on the part of state and city governments facing their own financial problems.</p>
<p>Riding to the rescue — to a degree, at least — are the banks, which are trying to take a leading position when it comes to not just corporate and employee donations of dollars and volunteer efforts but also in helping nonprofits figure out how to stay in business.</p>
<p><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016_Nonprofit_Outlook.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2088 alignright" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016_Nonprofit_Outlook-231x300.png" alt="2016_Nonprofit_Outlook" width="231" height="300" align="right" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016_Nonprofit_Outlook-231x300.png 231w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016_Nonprofit_Outlook.png 263w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a>A case in point is the newly published <a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/white-paper/2016-connecticut-nonprofit-industry-outlook/">“2016 Connecticut Nonprofit Industry Outlook: </a><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/white-paper/2016-connecticut-nonprofit-industry-outlook/">Breaking Through Challenges with Innovative Strategies,”</a> authored by Patriot Bank N.A. Among the report’s findings were that in fiscal year 2014, 78 percent of nonprofit organizations reported an increase in demand for programs and/or services – but only 56 percent were able to meet that increased demand.</p>
<p>In the meantime, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics, as of April Connecticut is home to 20,299 registered nonprofit organizations, many of which — 5,916 or 29 percent — are in Fairfield County.</p>
<p>The largest component of the Connecticut nonprofit sector consists of human service organizations (27 percent or 5,390 nonprofits), followed by public and societal benefit organizations (21 percent or 4,325 nonprofits) and faith-based organizations (12 percent or 2,369 nonprofits).</p>
<p>Nonprofits also provide substantial employment in the state. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012 the nonprofit industry employed 14.4 percent, or nearly 200,000 workers, of Connecticut’s total private sector workforce, exceeding the national average of 10.3 percent.</p>
<p>While it hardly comes as news that nonprofits are struggling financially, indications are that they face significant challenges as never before. Meanwhile, the number of nonprofits and the cost of operations continue to rise. According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics, 66 organizations were added in Connecticut from December 2015 to April, further diluting each organization’s piece of the pie.</p>
<p>And that, the banks say, is where they come in.</p>
<p>“These are organizations that struggle every single day to remain viable and continue to do the good work they set out to do,” said Susan Neilson, executive vice president and COO in the Stamford headquarters of Patriot Bank. “We pride ourselves on providing banking solutions, and focusing on nonprofits is who we are as a community bank.”</p>
<p>Beyond “helping them open a checking account and creating lending possibilities,” Neilson said Patriot often works with corporate partners like office products firm W.B. Mason and Spyglass Brand Marketing to provide materials on a donated or reduced-cost basis.</p>
<p>While most banks work with nonprofits on a case-by-case basis when educating them on the nuts-and-bolts of business, Patriot holds semi-regular seminars to provide both educational and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>In late June, more than 130 municipal and nonprofit leaders representing a broad array of organizations serving southern Connecticut and Westchester County participated in the bank’s “Give Your Nonprofit Organization a Fundraising Edge” event. A meeting focusing on cybersecurity is scheduled for later this year, Neilson said.</p>
<p>Patriot serendipitously found itself in the furniture business last year during a remodeling, at a time when both the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk and The Center for Family Justice in Bridgeport were looking to replace some well-worn office equipment. Each ended up with about $45,000 worth of what The Center for Family Justice President and CEO Debra Greenwood called “gently loved furniture.”</p>
<p>Greenwood said that Susan Neilson and her husband, Patriot National Bancorp Inc. President and CEO Kenneth Neilson, have also made significant monetary donations both personally and on behalf of the bank. Susan Neilson will serve as honorary chairman of the CFJ’s first anniversary gala next April in recognition of its rebranding from The Center for Women and Families of Eastern Fairfield County.</p>
<p>“Patriot has been so instrumental in helping us,” Greenwood said, “especially with making connections with groups like TANGO,” The Alliance for Nonprofit Growth and Opportunity, a Farmington-based organization that provides nonprofits with access to service professionals.</p>
<p>Greenwood met with TANGO personnel at an event last year at the Maritime Aquarium, whose president, Brian Davis, credited the Neilsons with helping to shine a light on the facility’s needs.</p>
<p>“They’re not just about making a donation and moving on,” he said. “They’re interested in building a continuing relationship with you and keeping engaged, which is really refreshing.”</p>
<p>Patriot has sponsored various meetings and exhibits at the aquarium, Davis said, noting that significant support has also been given by the likes of People’s United and Fairfield County Bank, “which have provided support from a direct financial standpoint and underwriting and providing educational programs and other resources for students that would otherwise not be available.”</p>

<p>STAMFORD — Velma Clark has taken on a number of roles during her 19 years with Pacific House — client-services advocate, shelter manager, residential services manager and now manager of all the nonprofit’s properties.</p>
<p>While her responsibilities with the organization that runs a Pacific Street homeless shelter and a number of affordable-housing properties have changed, her approach to her work has not.</p>
<p>“I love this nonprofit,” Clark said in an interview last week. “It’s my passion to work with and help people.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p></div>
<p>The work of Clark and others in her field are recognized in a report on Connecticut nonprofit organizations released last week by Stamford-based Patriot Bank. Nonprofits like Pacific House play a crucial role in their communities, delivering essential programs for their clients and creating a major source of employment, the study said.</p>
<p>The report also highlights the formidable challenges they face.</p>
<p>As demand has escalated, they have struggled in recent years to find funding to maintain their programming. But the report also lays out a path to sustainability: Nonprofits will need to cultivate strong relationships with public and private partners, including local businesses.</p>
<p><strong>A needed industry</strong></p>
<p>Nonprofits comprise a crucial part of the state’s economy, with more than 20,000 agencies employing nearly 200,000 people. That equates to about 14 percent of the state’s private workforce, according to the report, up from 13 percent in 2007.</p>
<p>Those organizations are arguably more important than ever, with 78 percent of nonprofits reporting an increase in demand for programs or services in the 2014 fiscal year.</p>
<p>But partly because government support is not matching the increasing needs, only 56 percent of agencies said that they were able to meet that increased demand. Between 2011 and 2014, federal funding as a percentage of nonprofits’ budgets decreased or remained the same for 74 percent of organizations. Support from the state declined or stagnated for 66 percent of nonprofits, and about 80 percent faced a similar predicament with local government funding.</p>
<p>“During the recession, it was tough,” said Michael Cotela, executive director of the Stamford Boys &amp; Girls Club. “A lot of nonprofits folded, but we came through it. We do have an endowment, and we could always count on that.”</p>
<p>The lack of funding has forced nonprofits to become more frugal, which creates its own issues.</p>
<p>“We’ve been operating on a balanced budget for the last eight years and have been able to at least make up some of those differences in funding,” said Rafael Pagan Jr., Pacific House’s executive director. “The challenge has been that I’ve not been able to really develop a reserve fund so we can be more viable in the case that something happens.”</p>
<p>Overall charitable giving has accounted for about 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product since the 1970s, the study said. In 2014, the total came to about $358 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Adapting to changes</strong></p>
<p>With tighter budgets, nonprofit leaders said their organizations have been forced to become more efficient.</p>
<p>Fewer employees means greater workloads. Around the time of the recession, Pacific House had about 40 people. The employee roster now totals 28.</p>
<p>“You worry as an executive about burnout,” Pagan said. “It’s hard when people take vacation time — if I only have one office manager and that person goes on vacation, who does the work?”</p>
<p>Nonprofits are reluctant to shift the burden of covering expenses onto clients. The Stamford Chamber of Commerce has not raised its rates since the last recession, said President and CEO Jack Condlin.</p>
<p>“It’s been a struggle, but we’ve survived,” Condlin said. “We meet our budget because we have to. It’s not like we can borrow money or raise dues. If I raise the dues rate, people drop out. If you raise dues (and) small business are struggling, that means they struggle more. We have to be there for them; they need us now.”</p>
<p>And prudent fiscal management can only go so far. Patriot Bank’s report cited research from the Nonprofit Finance Fund showing that 56 percent of Connecticut nonprofits reported having three months or less of operational cash on hand in the 2014 fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong>New opportunities</strong></p>
<p>While they still face formidable financial challenges, nonprofit leaders increasingly see reasons for optimism about their long-term outlooks. As grant funding for Pacific House has dropped, corporations have increased their sponsorship, Pagan said.</p>
<p>“Many of them put aside a certain amount for marketing, and it’s a lot easier to sponsor something because they’re also getting marketing,” Pagan said. “It’s an effective partnership.”</p>
<p>For-profit businesses have stepped up their support in other ways.</p>
<p>Among its programs that support nonprofits, Patriot Bank last month held a “Give Your Nonprofit Organization a Fundraising Edge” series of events, featuring nonprofit board leadership coach Michael Davidson. More than 130 leaders from organizations serving southern Connecticut and Westchester County, N.Y., participated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Patriot Bank values the nonprofit sector and understands that establishing a secure financial future is critical for so many important community-based organizations,” Robert Hojnacki, who leads Patriot Bank’s nonprofit and government banking divisions, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In some cases, public funding is picking up significantly. The State Bond Commission this month approved a $4.4 million allocation for the Boys &amp; Girls Club to support construction of a $15 million teen center, which would expand the club’s facility on Stillwater Avenue.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked really hard to create partnerships with individuals (and) the corporate world,” Cotela said. “Both the city and the state governments have been very generous. When we have what we need to get the job done, it’s a win-win for everyone.”</p>
<p>Amid the travails, nonprofit mainstays like Clark said their commitment to their work has not wavered.</p>
<p>“I see so many people prosper who come through the shelter,” Clark said. “It’s not a 9-to-5 job. I do what I have to do to get the job done. I want to keep doing it as long as I can.”</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">(Left to right): Patriot Bank President and CEO Kenneth Neilson, Al’s Angels Founder Al DiGuido and Westport Library Executive Director Bill Harmer</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local digital marketing entrepreneur and Al’s Angels Founder Al DiGuido recently offered insights and fielded questions from a variety of business leaders on the key strategies for building and leading successful businesses, as part of the Westport Library’s “Insight from Entrepreneurs” series.</p>
<p>Some 80 participants learned essential truths about what it takes to achieve success in a wide variety of business ventures during the interactive discussion, sponsored by Patriot Bank, N.A. and Bernstein Global Wealth Management.</p>
<p>“Patriot Bank is proud to support events like Westport Library’s ‘Insights from Entrepreneurs’, which makes CEO thought leadership accessible to current and aspiring business leaders,” said <strong>Kenneth Neilson, Patriot Bank President and CEO. </strong>“Mr. DiGuido offered his wisdom from many years as an entrepreneur, incorporating his principles for courage, passion, high energy and tremendous generosity into all of his endeavors.”</p>
<p>The discussion included key insights into identifying marketplace trends, leveraging technology to generate sales and profits, enhancing ROI performance, acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers. Mr. DiGuido also discussed his no-nonsense, direct and tactical approach to converting dreams into reality.</p>
<p>Mr. DiGuido is the founder of the Bridgeport-based nonprofit Al’s Angels, which provides moments of joy and comfort, as well as lifesaving medical treatment, to more than 9,000 children and families challenged by cancers, rare blood diseases, domestic violence and financial hardships. He is also CEO of Zeta Interactive, where he evolved the email business into a fully integrated technology platform, services and strategies operation.</p>
<p>“Much of success in business and achieving our goals and objectives is about winning small battles. If we try to take on the world as our first step&#8230;we can become distracted and disillusioned,” said <strong>Mr. DiGuido. </strong>“It was great to provide some focus to those who attended the seminar on the importance of understanding and obsessing over a customer&#8217;s need so as to provide products and services that truly satisfy that need. When we connect customer needs with our solution and market the unique selling proposition of our solution&#8230;we are focused in the right place to build something special.”</p>
<p>The entrepreneur has built an award-winning digital media and direct marketing career with successful businesses in publishing, digital media, non-profit and retail. Mr. DiGuido is known for his expertise in how evolving media platforms drive brand success in today’s economy.</p>
<p>“It is such a pleasure to be a part of a great collaborative effort with Patriot Bank and Bernstein Global Wealth Management to bring exceptional business leaders like Al DiGuido, with his global reach and local roots, to share insights with the community of Westport. It demonstrates the amazing talent that exists in our community and the generosity of experts in so many fields who come to the library and offer their wealth of experience each day,” said <strong>Westport Library Executive Director Bill Harmer.</strong></p>
<p>Past speakers of the “Insight from Entrepreneurs” series have included Rick Smilow, president and owner of The Institute of Culinary Education; Doug Bernstein, Westport resident and co-founder of <a href="http://www.melissaanddoug.com/">Melissa &amp; Doug®</a> toy company; and Joseph Zaffe, co-author of <em>Z.E.R.O.: Zero Paid Media as the New Marketing Model.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three cheers for the red, white and blue!</p>
<p>Bring your friends and family to Fairfield’s historic Town Green on Sunday, July 10, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to celebrate a special display of the Declaration of Independence at the Fairfield Museum’s Declaration Celebration. Pack a picnic or sample from local food trucks as you enjoy crafts, games, a British encampment, walking tours and family fun.</p>
<p>View a real British encampment that will simulate what Fairfield looked like when the Redcoats invaded. Experience life during the Revolutionary War by visiting with members of the 54th CT Regiment of Foot, a British regiment like the ones who invaded Fairfield in 1779. The members of the 54th will set up a British soldier’s encampment, explaining the equipment that was likely used during the British invasion of Fairfield as well as demonstrating the manual of arms. There might also be a need to proclaim the “King’s will” to those in attendance while being part of the force occupying the town for the day!</p>
<p>In addition, Burning of Fairfield Walking Tours are also being offered on July 10, every half hour 12:30-2 p.m. Stroll back in time while exploring the history and events surrounding the attack on Fairfield by the British on July 7-8, 1779. Pre-registration is required. Adults: $10; Students: $5. Sign up at <a href="https://2016burningfairfieldwalkingtours.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">https://2016burningfairfieldwalkingtours.eventbrite.com</a>.</p>
<p>In honor of the 240th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, visitors are invited to a view an early version of the Declaration of Independence, which will be on display July 1-17. The document on display is a print from a copperplate engraving that John Quincy Adams (as Secretary of State) commissioned when he realized the original Declaration was deteriorating from frequent use. Completed in 1823, it is the best representation of what the document looked like before the signatures began to fade. This version of the Declaration is one of six known copies printed on heavy paper, with the first edition imprint on top, and is loaned to the Museum by Seth Kaller, Inc. Other historic items will also be on display, including Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the journals of Congress in 1776, documents from Connecticut signers of the Declaration, and later items that reflect its legacy.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence display is sponsored by Patriot Bank. &#8220;Since the colonial era, Connecticut and its leaders have played a critical role in the founding and success of our nation,” <strong>said Kenneth Neilson, </strong>President<strong> and CEO at Patriot Bank, N.A.</strong> “Nearly 250 years ago the Patriots who founded and fought for America’s independence lived and worked right here in Fairfield County. Today we not only recognize but seek to emulate the role models they were in shaping the democracy that is the United States. It is a great honor for Patriot bank to support and sponsor the Fairfield Museum and History Center’s public display of our nation’s historic Declaration of Independence.”</p>
<p>Check the Fairfield Museum website, Fairfieldhistory.org, for updated information on food trucks and more. The Buzz Truck will be on site 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fairfield Museum &amp; History Center will host a Declaration Celebration at Fairfield’s historic Town Green on Sunday, July 10, from 10-4 to celebrate their special display of the Declaration of Independence. Attendees may pack a picnic or sample from a local food truck. There also will be crafts, games, a British encampment and walking tours.<a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Declaration.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2052 alignright" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Declaration-250x300.jpg" alt="Declaration of Independence" width="250" height="300" align="right" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Declaration-250x300.jpg 250w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Declaration.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></p>
<p>View a real British encampment that will simulate what Fairfield looked like when the Redcoats invaded. Experience life during the Revolutionary War by visiting with members of the 54th CT Regiment of Foot, a British regiment like the ones who invaded Fairfield in 1779. The members of the 54th will set up a British soldier’s encampment, explaining the equipment that was likely used during the British invasion of Fairfield as well as demonstrating the manual of arms. There might also be a need to proclaim the “King’s will” to those in attendance while being part of the force occupying the town for the day!</p>
<p>In addition, Burning of Fairfield Walking Tours also are being offered on July 10, every half hour from 12:30-2 p.m. Stroll back in time while exploring the history and events surrounding the attack on Fairfield by the British on July 7-8, 1779. Advance registration is required. Adults: $10; students: $5. Sign up at 2016burningfairfieldwalkingtours.eventbrite.com.</p>
<p>In honor of the 240th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, visitors are invited to a view an early version of the Declaration of Independence, which will be on display July 1-17. The document on display is a print from a copperplate engraving that John Quincy Adams (as Secretary of State) commissioned when he realized the original Declaration was deteriorating from frequent use. Completed in 1823, it is the best representation of what the document looked like before the signatures began to fade. This version of the Declaration is one of six known copies printed on heavy paper, with the first edition imprint on top, and is loaned to the Museum by Seth Kaller, Inc. Other historic items will also be on display, including Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the journals of Congress in 1776, documents from Connecticut signers of the Declaration, and later items that reflect its legacy.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence display is sponsored by Patriot Bank. “Since the colonial era, Connecticut and its leaders have played a critical role in the founding and success of our nation,” said Kenneth Neilson, President and CEO at Patriot Bank, N.A. “Nearly 250 years ago the Patriots who founded and fought for America’s independence lived and worked right here in Fairfield County. Today we not only recognize but seek to emulate the role models they were in shaping the democracy that is the United States. It is a great honor for Patriot bank to support and sponsor the Fairfield Museum and History Center’s public display of our nation’s historic Declaration of Independence.”</p>
<p>Check the Fairfield Museum website, Fairfieldhistory.org, for updated information on food trucks and more. The Buzz Truck will be on site from 10-1.</p>

More than 150 Fairfield County high school students, comprising 42 teams, competed in a stock market challenge competition on Thursday, April 28 at the Stamford Italian Center, offered by Junior Achievement of Southwest Connecticut (JASWCT).</p>
<p>“This is dealing with the market in action. This is hands-on and in real time,” said Ray Milo, a business and technology teacher at Academy of Information Technology Engineering, located in Stamford.</p>
<p>Each team of four students representing local high schools was issued $500,000 virtual cash to buy or sell shares in 26 public companies. The mock trades were instantaneously projected to three screens and tracked stock prices, stock performance graphs and illustrated school team names with portfolio values and rankings.</p>
<p>Students from two schools had the opportunity to meet Kenneth Neilson, president and CEO of Patriot Bank, along with Patriot’s Chief Financial Officer Neil McDonnell and Chief Credit Officer Samuel Davis, who also serves on the board of Junior Achievement. Patriot Bank sponsored two teams from AITE and King Low Heywood Thomas.</p>
<p>“The Stock Market Challenge offers a fun, interactive way for students to develop and sharpen their financial skills that can be applied in the real world and perhaps result in a career direction,” said Kenneth Neilson, Patriot Bank, N.A. president and CEO. “Most Connecticut high schools do not require students to take financial literacy lessons to graduate, so programs like this give more students the opportunity to learn above saving and investing.”</p>
