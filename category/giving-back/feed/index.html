				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday an unlikely group of middle school students on the Greenwich Youth Football League’s BANC Raiders football team head to the playoffs with a proud 3-5 record.</p>
<p>While possessing a sub-500 percent record, the coach and players, along with the Byram community recognize the odds they have to overcome against some of the other opponents.</p>
<p>The BANC Raiders will dress 15 players this Sunday, Nov 12 for their playoff bout against the Cos Cob Crushers who are 8-0.</p>
<p>“Our record may be sub-500, but this is a team of winners. These young men have fought the odds, challenged expectations, and come out on the field with great community spirit and incredible resiliency,” said Coach Richard Muskus Jr. “I’m incredibly proud of the inspiration they have become.”  Muskus, who played three years of NCAA college football, also happens to be President of Stamford based Patriot Bank.</p>
<p>The story of the team’s climb, from having zero coaching staff at all to making the playoffs, began three years ago when Muskus was asked to “lend a hand” for a team of 12 and 13 year old’s sponsored by the Byram Archibald Neighborhood Center.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stamford Academy high school students recently gained career insights from Fairfield County business and community leaders during its 5th Annual Career Conversation. Dozens of students, from grades nine through 12, rotated classrooms for 30-minute conversations about finding, beginning, keeping and advancing in a job.</p>
<div id="attachment_2345" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2345" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-300x183.jpg" alt="Patriot bankers with Stamford Academy students at the 5th Annual Career Conversation " width="300" height="183" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-300x183.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-768x467.jpg 768w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Patriot-Bankers-at-Stamford-Academy-Career-Conversation2-1024x623.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #003366;"><small>Patriot bankers with Stamford Academy students at the 5th Annual Career Conversation<br />Photo credit: Samantha Latulippe</small></span></p></div>
<p>Students were encouraged to consider how their knowledge and interests could develop a career path. Volunteers offered personal experiences to suggest best approaches to skill-building, educational or vocational training, and job searching.</p>
<p>Fairfield County-based Patriot Bank, N.A. was among the volunteers that participated in this event as part of its continuous efforts to serve the communities its bankers live and work in. Other volunteers included Stamford Police, Stamford Firefighters, local attorneys, entrepreneurs, social service workers and community organization leaders.</p>
<p>The event was held at Stamford Academy, the second charter school opened by Domus, a non-profit that serves more than 1,100 youth in Stamford and New Haven, CT. Stamford Academy opened in 2004 for students who struggled in traditional school environments or had dropped out of school. Its intensive academic program allows students to catch up on instruction in preparation for post-secondary education or training upon graduation.</p>
<p>“I believe this conversation format allows for extremely unique and organic conversations. When I was walking in and out of classrooms, each conversation was very different from the others because the volunteers tailor them to the group of students in front of them,” said Stamford Academy Principal Andrea Weller. “This year we were lucky to have a wide range of volunteers from all different walks of life. The great commonality they shared was their high level of care for our students. This was evident through the content of the conversations and the fact that the conversations overflowed into lunch time.”</p>

<p>“This year we were able to increase the demographic and employment diversity of the volunteers making it the most interactive, engaging, and meaningful conversation yet. It was wonderful to see four Patriot Bank employees join forces with the 34 other volunteers to talk with Stamford Academy Charter High School students about their hopes, dreams, and plans for the future,” said Julia Wade, DOMUS Director of Volunteers.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly inspiring to meet with Stamford Academy students and learn how they are incorporating their interests and skills into their career plans. I’m glad our business and community leaders were able to pass on morsels of knowledge that have been instrumental to their success. These students’ interest and willingness to start building their careers now is a great sign for Stamford’s next generation workforce,” said Joshua Brown, an Assistant Vice President at Patriot Bank.</p>
<p>Patriot bankers Judith Corprew, Robert Hojnacki, Carolyn Wilder and Joshua Brown were among those who discussed how they arrived at their career paths and the steps they took to achieve their aspirations. They spoke about the importance of defining goals, pursuing education and internships, and how to explore job prospects.</p>
<p>Volunteers had lunch with the students following the classroom sessions to continue the dialogue in an open, informal setting.</p>

<p>According to the federal Housing and Urban Development<a href="http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2016/02-2016/Gov__Malloy_Announces_Connecticut_Receives_Federal_Certification_of_Effectively_Eliminating_Veteran_Homelessness/"><sup>1</sup></a>, Connecticut is the second state to end veteran homelessness and is close to being the first state to end chronic homelessness, making it crucial that these impacted individuals acquire financial skills to build a more secure future.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, Patriot Bank, N.A. is providing complimentary financial literacy and counseling to veterans and others who receive help from Homes with Hope, a Westport-based non-profit providing shelter, permanent supportive housing, food and case management.</p>
<p>At Patriot’s 2<sup>nd</sup> annual event at Homes with Hope, over a dozen participants learned about managing money, credit and budgeting basics and began to create a viable plan to begin securing their financial futures. Topics included how to create a budget, open a bank account, establish short- and long-term savings plans, and establish and maintain credit.</p>
<p>The seminar was presented by 16-year banking industry veteran Monique Mason, Assistant Branch Manager at Patriot Bank in Westport.</p>
<p>“There are so many individuals who fall and remain victims to the vicious cycle of homelessness in part because they were never taught basic financial literacy,” said <strong>Ms. Mason.</strong> “Too often, their situation is exacerbated by taking out cash advances or payday loans, which come with high fees and exorbitant interest rates. Patriot bankers are working with some of these veterans and others to take steps to improve their own financial situations, beginning with opening a checking account without fees and considering credit card options towards eventually establishing better credit.”</p>

<p><br />
<br />
More than 150 Fairfield County high school students, comprising 42 teams, competed in a stock market challenge competition on Thursday, April 28 at the Stamford Italian Center, offered by Junior Achievement of Southwest Connecticut (JASWCT).</p>
<p>“This is dealing with the market in action. This is hands-on and in real time,” said Ray Milo, a business and technology teacher at Academy of Information Technology Engineering, located in Stamford.</p>
<p>Each team of four students representing local high schools was issued $500,000 virtual cash to buy or sell shares in 26 public companies. The mock trades were instantaneously projected to three screens and tracked stock prices, stock performance graphs and illustrated school team names with portfolio values and rankings.</p>
<p>Students from two schools had the opportunity to meet Kenneth Neilson, president and CEO of Patriot Bank, along with Patriot’s Chief Financial Officer Neil McDonnell and Chief Credit Officer Samuel Davis, who also serves on the board of Junior Achievement. Patriot Bank sponsored two teams from AITE and King Low Heywood Thomas.</p>
<p>“The Stock Market Challenge offers a fun, interactive way for students to develop and sharpen their financial skills that can be applied in the real world and perhaps result in a career direction,” said Kenneth Neilson, Patriot Bank, N.A. president and CEO. “Most Connecticut high schools do not require students to take financial literacy lessons to graduate, so programs like this give more students the opportunity to learn above saving and investing.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ruskin had made a “bunch” of money on Dutch Oil only to lose some on RBC, two stocks available for students to trade in a mock stock market challenge offered by Junior Achievement of Southwest Connecticut in Stamford on Thursday.</p>
<p>Such is life in the day of a stock market trader during often volatile markets.</p>
<p>“This event really drives home what would happen on the floor of the exchange,” said Ray Milo, Ruskins’ teacher. Much like real traders, students in Thursday’s exercise had to pay attention to the news, market swings and the states of different industries, he said.</p>
<p>The event was sponsored by local companies, including Stamford-based Patriot Bank, which had teams from the Academy of Information Technology &amp; Engineering and King.</p>
<p>Patriot CEO Ken Neilson said the event helps educate students on the basics of financial literacy. “We think this is an important event in teaching young people how the stock market works, how to invest and it prepares for their future life,” he said.</p>

<p>Patriot Bank, N.A. is helping the Center for Family Justice provide free, confidential services to thousands of domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse victims from across Bridgeport, Easton, Fairfield, Monroe, Stratford and Trumbull. The Bridgeport-based non-profit began as a YWCA in 1895 and today serves more than 8,500 individuals annually.</p>
<p>On April 4, the Center for Family Justice celebrated the grand opening of Connecticut’s only facility offering trauma-informed services and coordinated care under one roof (753 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport), with furniture donated by Fairfield County-based Patriot Bank.</p>
<p>The facility is Connecticut’s first Family Justice Center and only one of three in New England. Some 30 local nonprofits will be housed there, including the State Department of Children and Families, LifeBridge, Triangle Community Center and The Workplace.</p>
<p>At its recent Gratitude Gala, the Center for Family Justice acknowledged Patriot Bank and other business and community leaders who are contributing to its renovation, including Governor Dannel Malloy and his wife Cathy Malloy, who served as executive director at a rape crisis center for more than a decade. Ms. Malloy said the Center for Family Justice will be a model for Family Justice Centers throughout the state. The Malloys advocated for a $1.2 million state bond that helped underwrite the expansion.</p>
<p>The professional-grade office furnishings allow clients, nonprofit partners and service providers all new professional workspaces. Services including therapy, counseling, civil/legal attorneys, law enforcement guidance, professional development and professional help for victims from all six towns will be in one safe place, simplifying the process of offering help for thousands of victims.</p>
<p>“Patriot Bank believes in extending a helping hand to our neighbors. Patriot’s donation to the Center for Family Justice enables the facility to have a more comfortable and professional atmosphere from day one. The alleviated expenses will result in the Center being able to serve many more clients,” <strong>said Kenneth Neilson, Patriot Bank, N.A. President &amp; CEO.</strong></p>
<p>“Patriot Bank truly shows its commitment by doing, beginning with the communities it serves. The bank’s generous donation will allow the Justice Center to bring in more local partners, resources and services to simplify the process for victims, who may receive comprehensive care here in just one to two visits, versus having to go out to seven different organizations to see services they require,”<strong>said Debra Greenwood, the CEO of The Center for Family Justice, Inc. </strong>“Family Justice Centers save communities a lot of money and stop 30% of criminal cases we see in judicial centers. Most importantly, it saves lives.”</p>
<p>The newly renovated facility will feature a plaque acknowledging Patriot Bank, N.A. as a partner. The materials for the inscription are being donated by SIGNLite and the design will be donated by Spyglass Brand Marketing.</p>

<p></p>
<p>“Hope starts here” is one of the mottos of Connecticut’s first Family Justice Center, and that sentiment was on full display Monday, April 4, with the center’s official opening, a milestone in the way victims of domestic and sexual violence receive services in the greater Bridgeport area.</p>
<p>The center has completed the first phase of a $1.2-million renovation of its Bridgeport campus, which will make room for offices for a host of community partners, including police, prosecutors and attorneys.</p>
<p>The partners can now provide on-site assistance to thousands of women, men and children by offering a full complement of help under one roof, thereby streamlining the way victims engage with supportive services and the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The center becomes one of more than 100 Family Justice Centers around the globe, following the nation’s first Family Justice Center, which was established in San Diego, Calif., in 2002.</p>
<p>“This has been a true, collaborative community effort achieved with the common goal of turning victims into survivors,” Debra A. Greenwood, president/CEO of the center, said. “So many people, from our local legislative delegation to our board members and local police chiefs, have played a critical role in helping us make this dream a reality.”</p>
<p>All services are free and confidential. The center works with an operating budget of approximately $2.7 million, derived from a variety of sources. About 44% comes from state and federal grants designated for domestic and sexual assault services.</p>
<p>The remainder comes from private foundation grants, fund-raising events, and private and corporate donors.  The center discloses its financial statements on its website, CenterforFamilyJustice.org.</p>
<p>Key features of the renovated headquarters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Furnishings with a value of $40,000 donated by Patriot Bank NA for the 21,000-square-foot center. The office furnishings provide new professional workspaces for clients, nonprofit partners and service providers.</li>
<li>A renovated lower level housing offices for police officers and prosecutors and representatives from several local agencies that will serve as on-site community partners.</li>
<li>The lower level Bigelow Tea Wellness room, which will promote healthy lifestyle practices, including yoga and meditation for clients who’ve experienced trauma.</li>
<li>The upper level Verizon Empowerment Room, which will be outfitted with computer stations, serving as a training and technology hub for clients seeking to build employment skills to achieve self-sufficiency.</li>
<li>Renovated rooms for child care, meetings and client services.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The goal is always to transform victims into survivors who can lead safe, healthy and productive lives,” Greenwood said.</p>
