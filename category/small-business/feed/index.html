				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Dec. 14 – the second such increase in a year and only the second, too, since December 2008 – drew mixed reactions nationwide from banking and economic experts. Many saw it as an encouraging sign of an ongoing, if slow, national economic recovery, while others viewed it as possibly lessening both banks’ profitability and consumers’ interest in and ability to afford loans.</p>
<p>But Connecticut area banks, which collectively were on pace to post strong results for 2016, maintain that the Dec. 14 rate increase – from a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent to a range of 0.5 to 0.75 percent – is small enough to not have an adverse effect. Further, they said that expected additional increases this year – likely two or three – should not noticeably dampen business.</p>
<p>Fairfield County bankers said they are most concerned about the small business segment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rick_Muskus_032ret.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2376 alignnone" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rick_Muskus_032ret-215x300.jpg" alt="rick_muskus_032ret" width="215" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><small><small>Rick Muskus, Patriot Bank Chief Lending Officer</small></small></span></p>
<p>At Patriot Bank in Stamford, Richard A. Muskus, executive vice president and chief lending officer, noted that if debt services rise incrementally for small businesses, “They will have to make changes to their business model and business planning. Additional rate increases could limit their cash flow to the point where they may not be able to hire that additional person or be in a position to borrow money for equipment or another store.”</p>
<p>“Should a small business owner be expanding or contracting in this environment? Only the individual business owner knows for sure,” Muskus said. Taking on additional employees or equipment without the ability to turn it into revenue right away can be especially concerning in light of interest rate hikes, he said.</p>
<p>Muskus said that Patriot is “executing well” on the 21 percent of its overall business that comes via small business loans; he’d noted earlier that historically just 11 percent of the bank’s business comes from that sector. He added that one of the bank’s “target goals” is to become an approved U.S. Small Business Administration lender in the first quarter of this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small business loans have notably increased in Fairfield County this year, with area banks saying they expect the trend to continue into 2017.</p>
<p>Rick Muskus, executive vice president and chief lending officer at Patriot Bank in Stamford, said that historically 11 percent of Patriot’s business has come via small business loans. “But as of today we have 21 percent in the pipeline that fits the small business category,” he said. “For the past few months, we’ve seen a lot of people starting new businesses or purchasing an existing business due to aging ownership or for other reasons.” That trend has been particularly noticeable in the restaurant and liquor store business, he said.</p>
<p>Still, Muskus noted that the county “is not an inexpensive market to start businesses in. They need a solid banking partner, and we’re actively working to improve and expand our presence in the sector. We’re working with our branch and assistant branch managers all the way down to our tellers to learn more about our small business loan program, not just to discuss with customers but also so they can talk knowledgably about it in their non-professional life.” He said that up to 80 percent of Patriot’s business comes from word of mouth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven years after the end of the recession, the extent of Main Street’s recovery continues to spark debate.</p>
<p>The drop in loans to small businesses in the aftermath of the economic crisis has not escaped the attention of the nation’s top politicians, including Hillary Clinton. The Democratic presidential nominee has described an arduous lending environment for small-business owners — an assessment that has provoked mixed reactions in Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>Access to capital</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of the recession, small-business lending significantly declined. Nationwide, lending institutions’ loans outstanding to small businesses totaled about $712 billion in 2008, according to the most recent Small Business Administration report. That total dropped to about $585 billion in 2013, the latest year for which data is available.</p>
<p>In her acceptance speech for her party’s presidential nomination last month at the Democratic National Convention, Clinton suggested that she was not satisfied with small businesses’ access to capital.</p>
<p>“We will give small businesses like my dad’s a boost,” Clinton said. “Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.”</p>
<p>Clinton’s assessment of banks’ willingness to lend drew mixed responses among Stamford bankers. Ken Neilson, president and CEO of Patriot Bank, described the comments as “political talk” that did not recognize banks’ ongoing support of small businesses.</p>
<p>“Patriot and probably most of the other banks want to lend to small businesses as much as they safely can and have always wanted to,” Neilson said. “What we need is more small businesses being started. And the best thing that government can do to foster that is to ease up on regulations and taxes and give people an incentive to start businesses.”</p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not specifically mention small-business financing in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention or in an economic speech last Monday in Detroit.</p>
<p>At Patriot, the total value of loans outstanding has grown from $479 million last December to a current total of about $527 million.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following letter, authored by Patriot Bank, N.A. President Kenneth Neilson, was published by Patch Westport.</em></p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Westport’s New England charm draws many residents and visitors here, but it is small businesses that make up the lifeblood of its economy. Residents should patronize these businesses because shopping locally year-round keeps local economies strong and resilient.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), there are over 28 million small businesses in America, providing 55 percent of all jobs and accounting for 54 percent of all sales. In Westport, a walk down Saugatuck Avenue reveals how important they really are.</p>
<p>Neighborhood retailers offer products and services that meet the specific needs of our communities and then recycle that spending back into the local economy. According to research firm Civic Economics, for every $100 spent at local small businesses, $68 stays in the community.</p>
<p>Small business also creates many jobs for local residents and contributes to keeping unemployment among the lowest in the state. Statewide, small businesses employed 721,350 people or 49 percent of the private workforce in 2013, according to the SBA.</p>
<p>Wonderful examples of local entrepreneurs in our own backyard include Tutti’s, a family-owned restaurant serving delicious homemade Italian cuisine since 2002, and Westport Anti-Aging that has provided skincare services since 2004, both of which have exerted considerable years, talent and resources to build long-term relationships with clients and cater to local customers’ needs.</p>
<p>As important as it is for consumers to make the conscious choice to shop locally, government leaders, financial institutions and other decision-makers need to help further create a climate that encourages independent businesses to open and thrive.</p>
<p>Small business owners typically wear many hats: running operations, supervising staff, maintaining a balance sheet, ensuring licensing and permits are updated, and so much more. Simplifying their financial lives shouldn’t be an added burden.</p>
<p>As a community bank with a branch in downtown Westport, Patriot’s local bankers prioritize getting to know small business owners and their companies so that when business challenges arise, a team is already in place to find creative solutions and financial arrangements that make sense.</p>
<p>Educational resources that provide guidance for business owners to grow and expand their companies are also vital. Along with resources we offer at a local level, the SBA celebrates small business by regularly offering events and webinars about how to access capital, reduce costs, retain employees and market effectively.</p>
<p>Everyone in this community has a stake in ensuring Westport’s small business community succeeds. Residents should make buying local a priority, financial institutions can offer expertise and public officials should support policies that encourage small businesses to open.</p>
<p>Kenneth Neilson<br />
President &amp; CEO<br />
Patriot Bank, N.A.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">By Patriot Bank President &amp; CEO Kenneth Neilson</p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">Norwalk City Hall recently welcomed the Connecticut Small Business Development Center (CTSBDC), offering free advisory services to small business owners about challenges they face. The center is part of the U.S. Small Business Administration network, one of only 1,000 throughout the country helping more than 1 million American businesses annually.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">Across Connecticut between 2013 and 2014, these centers helped start up a new business every 31 minutes (17,207 new businesses), employ someone every 5 minutes (98,860 new workers) and generate $100,000 in sales every 7 minutes ($7.1 billion in new sales) of those years that were calculated.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">We should applaud the city and the Small Business Development Center for focusing their critical efforts in helping this vital sector of our economy, which includes existing, startup and expanding businesses in a range of industries, owned by veterans, women and minority entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">Norwalk’s greatest asset is its diverse small business community, which is a cornerstone of the local economy.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">The majority of Connecticut businesses has fewer than 20 employees and, in 2013, provided jobs for more than 250,000 people, or 17 percent of the total workforce. Examples of local entrepreneurs in the community range from My Three Sons, a family entertainment center owned by a Norwalk native whose grown sons and daughter help run the business, to Triple S, another family-owned business which has provided textile cleaning services to the community since 1963.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">The sixth largest city in Connecticut, Norwalk is home to thousands of small businesses that are typically locally operated, providing gainful employment to many thousands of area residents. With local roots, these companies also understand and help respond to the community’s unique needs, making the small business marketplace fertile ground for ideas and innovation.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans','serif';">What’s critical is that every time a resident supports a local business, they are casting a vote to keep economic development within the community. This makes small business a critical economic driver. According to research firm Civic Economics, for every $100 spent at local small businesses, $68 of that sum gets reinvested in the community. Taxes paid to local governments are used to maintain roads, sidewalks and parks; to pay for police, firefighters and EMTs to keep communities safe; and help keep our schools.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">November was the city’s Small Business Month and families shopped, dined and spent time with the businesses that form the backbone and beating heart of their local communities. But what about the remaining 11 months of the year?</p>
<p>Milford is home to more than 3,100 diverse small businesses and specialty shops. As we move into the holiday shopping season, it is important to remember that local business owners are our neighbors, friends and families.  Their survival and ability to thrive depends on all 50,000 residents shopping close to home, all throughout the year.</p>
<p>As Milford Mayor Benjamin Blake recently said, “Milford’s independently owned, small businesses keep money in the local economy, sustain and create jobs and support environmental responsibility and sustainable practices.”</p>
<p>Federal employment data shows that small businesses provide 55% of all U.S. jobs and have accounted for 65% of all net job growth since the 1970s, while adding 8 million new jobs over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>Small businesses strengthen local economies and generate revenue for the essential services we all rely upon, from infrastructure, roads and sewers to schools to the first responders who protect and keep us safe.</p>
<p>According to research by economic analysis firm Civic Economics, for every $100 spent at local small businesses, $68 is reinvested in the community.  These merchants are also more likely to buy locally, creating a multiplier effect and as the expression goes, a rising tide lifts all boats.</p>
<p>Encouraging residents to shop close to home for the staples they need is not only convenient but also feeds local entrepreneurship, jobs and opportunity.</p>
<p>Consider for instance the local family-owned restaurant, Park Lane Deli and Grille, which has been serving the community now for half-a-century. Since the 1960s, this hometown favorite has employed hundreds of local youth and college students, while providing residents a familiar place where they are personally greeted.</p>
<p>Equally important, local nonprofits like the Milford Arts Council offer vital cultural programming, as it has for over 40 years. The Council hosts an annual Milford Student Art Show and theater camps to enrich, entertain and cultivate the artistic minds of children and teens. Such local institutions and their efforts shape and define our town.</p>
<p>Simply put, local businesses and community-based non-profits are critical. The economic importance, not to mention the uniqueness and charm, of great communities such as Milford is hard to overstate.  Instead of devoting a day or month to recognizing their significance, let’s do so all throughout the year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mayor Benjamin Blake presented members of the Downtown Milford Business Association (DMBA) with a Small Business Month Proclamation in support of local businesses serving as the heartbeat of Downtown Milford.

<p>“Milford’s independently owned, small businesses keep money in the local economy, sustain and create jobs and support environmental responsibility and sustainable practices. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our community,” said Mayor Blake.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank President &amp; CEO Ken Neilson, said, “The economic impact, uniqueness and charm that downtown Milford’s small shops and restaurants bring are tremendous and need to be spotlighted.

Patriot is dedicated to growing and supporting local communities. That’s why we’re honored to play a key role as Title Sponsor of Milford Small Business Month.”</p>
<p>Free workshops will be held the first four Mondays in November, from 5:30 – 7 p.m. at the Milford Public Library Community Room (57 New Haven Ave.). Each week a specific topic will be presented by panelists featuring DMBA members and local business leaders, with a Q&amp;A session to follow. Patriot Bank will offer free financial/banking information. Refreshments will be served.</p>
