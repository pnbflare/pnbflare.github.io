				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Kevin Zimmerman</p>
<p class="Glypha-Drop-Cap"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">F</span>or an institution that was once near the brink of collapse, Patriot National Bank has made an impressive comeback — and it’s not done yet, according to chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza.</p>
<p class="Body-text">“The bank has never been as profitable as it is today,” Carrazza said at his office in Patriot’s headquarters at 900 Bedford St. in Stamford. “We took an aggressive approach to turning it around and we will continue with that approach.”</p>
<p class="Body-text">Dividends have been coming fast and furious for Patriot over the past several months.</p>
<p class="Body-text">In August, it posted second-quarter pretax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804,000. Those are significant increases over the year-ago quarter’s pretax loss of $948,000 and net loss of $582,000. For the six months ended June 30, net income was $2.5 million, compared with $71,000 for the first half of 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot National Bancorp, parent company of Patriot Bank, continued its push into the New Haven County market Wednesday, announcing an agreement to acquire Prime Bank in Orange.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot Bank already has a branch office in Milford. But it is the Stamford-based bank’s only New Haven County location, so the acquisition of Prime Bank, which has only one branch, will increase Patriot Bank’s presence in southwestern New Haven County.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Full terms of the deal were not released, but the acquisition will be paid for in cash, according to Patriot National officials. The deal is subject to approval by Prime’s shareholders and banking regulators.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot National officials said Prime shareholders will receive aggregate cash payment equal to 115 percent of Prime’s tangible book value as of the deal’s closing date, which is expected to occur sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Prime Bank’s tangible book value as of June 30 was approximately $9 million.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">“The acquisition of Prime Bank will support our operating goals of extending Patriot Bank’s footprint, building scale, and improving key operating metrics, all of which ultimately adds value for our shareholders and customers,” Michael Carrazza, Patriot chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Jasper Jaser, Prime’s chief executive officer, said the deal “meets the objectives of our shareholders, customers and employees.” Officials with both banks did not provide information regarding the number of employees that Prime has.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">“Our customers will benefit from increased services and expanded product and lending capabilities,” Jaser said in a statement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">John Carusone, president of the Bank Analysis Center, a Hartford-based industry consulting firm, said the acquisition of Prime continues Patriot Bank’s rise from near financial ruin in 2010.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">It was founded in 1994 by Fred DeCaro Jr., who was a principal in several Westchester County automobile dealerships, according to Carusone. But a series of bad loans that were made to luxury home developers nearly ruined the bank after Connecticut’s market for expensive real estate took a nosedive during the last recession, he said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Carrazza, a former Goldman Sachs executive, stepped in with an investor group and recapitalized Patriot National with $60 million. Then Carrazza and his fellow investors bought out the bank shareholders “for pennies on the dollar,” according to Carusone.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot” or the “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:<a href="https://globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=PNBK&amp;exchange=2">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), and Prime Bank headquartered in Orange, CT (“Prime”) (PMHV:US) jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Patriot will acquire Prime. The acquisition will expand Patriot’s community banking presence and footprint in Southern Connecticut.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $55.8 million in deposits and $27.8 million in total loans.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement Prime shareholders will receive aggregate cash consideration equal to 115% of Prime’s tangible book value as of the closing date. The acquisition will result in a new Patriot branch located in the Town of Orange, in New Haven County.  The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter 2017 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and Prime shareholder approval.</p>
<p><strong>Patriot Chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza</strong> stated<strong>,</strong> “The acquisition of Prime Bank will support our operating goals of extending Patriot Bank’s footprint, building scale, and improving key operating metrics, all of which ultimately adds value for our shareholders and customers.”</p>
<p><strong>Richard Muskus Jr.</strong>, Patriot’s President, added, “The acquisition will enable Patriot Bank to expand its consumer and small business relationships, lending operations, and community presence, while offering Prime’s current customers a broader suite of products.”</p>
<p>In the second fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported pre-tax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804 thousand, or $0.21 per diluted share.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income was $2.5 million or $0.65 per diluted share.  In July 2017, Patriot announced the reinstatement of its dividend policy and declared its first quarterly dividend for shareholders since 2008.</p>
<p>Patriot anticipates that Prime’s branch staff will join Patriot to assist in a seamless transition and continue to help drive growth efforts and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Prime CEO Jasper J. Jaser</strong> stated, “We are pleased to announce this transaction, as we believe merging into Patriot meets the objectives of our shareholders, customers and employees.  Our customers will benefit from increased services and expanded product and lending capabilities; our branch employees will be part of a larger organization and branch network, offering broader career opportunities.”</p>
<p><strong>Paul Lutsky, Prime’s Vice President</strong>, added, “The merger will support Patriot’s growth strategies, allowing it to leverage its larger capital base and legal lending limits to provide broader lending solutions to Prime’s customers.”</p>
<p>Prime Bank shareholders will receive detailed information about the transaction in a proxy statement that will be sent to them in connection with a special shareholders’ meeting to approve the transaction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp Inc., the parent company of Patriot Bank N.A., has announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank’s stock for the first time since 2008.</p>
<p>Patriot declared its first quarterly dividend of 1 cent per share, with a record date of July 24 and a dividend payment date of Aug. 1. This is the first time since the financial crisis that the bank has declared a dividend.</p>

<p>Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30.</p>
<p>At the end of its 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone. <a href="https://westfaironline.com/89060/patriot-bank-posts-165-percent-net-income-increase/">In the first fiscal quarter of 2017</a>, Patriot reported net income of $1.73 million or 44 cents per diluted share, a 165 percent increase over the prior year. First-quarter earnings increased 66 percent over the prior quarter.</p>
<p>As of March 31, total bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared with $636 million on March 31, 2016. Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30 percent over $480 million on March 31, 2016. Deposits grew to $561 million as of March 31, compared with $424 million at March 31, 2016. The bank has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32 percent over the last year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot Bank collected a $2.8 million payout last week for an insurance claim tied to an unpaid loan made to a bankrupt Stamford developer.</p>
<p>The claim arose from what Patriot officials described as “borrower fraud” involving a $3 million bridge loan made in 2014 by Patriot to Seaboard Realty LLC and affiliates for the construction of properties including a Marriott Residence Inn on Atlantic Street in the city’s downtown. The Residence Inn remains uncompleted.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to bring this arduous recovery effort to a satisfactory conclusion,” Michael Carrazza, Patriot’s chairman and interim CEO, said in a statement. “The result is immediately and materially accretive for Patriot and its shareholders, and this event complements the positive momentum Patriot has been experiencing.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp Inc. has received payment of nearly $2.8 million from its fidelity insurer in connection with a claim of loss submitted by its bank operating subsidiary, Patriot Bank, headquartered in Stamford.</span></p>
<p>The payment stems from a $3 million bridge loan provided by Patriot to Seaboard Realty LLC, in conjunction with the construction of a Marriott Residence Inn on Atlantic Street in Stamford. Seaboard, along with its affiliates, owned and was constructing multiple high-profile properties in the city’s downtown, including the Courtyard Marriott on Summer Street, the 1 Atlantic St. office building and the Park Square residential development on Summer Street.</span></p>
<p>Seaboard’s subsequent bankruptcy, coupled with uncertainty of collection, led to the bank’s loan loss as reported on Form 8-K on Sept. 19, 2016. At that time, the bank was unable to obtain confirmation from its insurer that any amounts would be covered under its policy.</span></p>

In the 3<sup>rd </sup>quarter of 2016, Patriot reported a healthy rise in net income of $814,000, or $0.21 diluted income per share.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $74 million (nearly 11%) to $757 million, as compared to $683 million at September 30, 2016 and $653 million at December 31, 2015.  Net loans, up 4%, totaled $577 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $553 million at September 30, 2016 and $479 million at December 31, 2015.</p>
<p>Deposits grew 12% or $58 million to $529 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to $471 million at September 30, 2016 and $445 million at December 31, 2015.  Deposit growth was one of the key initiatives launched in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter and continued through December 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Recent management changes and operational initiatives have contributed to Patriot’s notable boost in profitability over the last two quarters.</p>
<p>“Patriot’s performance, achieving 29% earnings growth in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter and 28% earnings growth in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter is a direct result of ongoing performance enhancing strategies being executed by our team,” said Michael Carrazza.  “These results evidence the effectiveness of our strategies.”</p>
<p>Mr. Carrazza took operational control of Patriot, as interim CEO, in August 2016 to carry out a series of value-enhancing strategies and to reposition the executive team.  In January 2017, Mr. Richard Muskus was internally promoted to President and Mr. Joseph Perillo was retained as a senior financial advisor to assist in the execution of performance improvement initiatives. “We expect these enhancements to contribute to a steady increase in franchise value,” added Mr. Carrazza.</p>
<p>The loan pipeline remains strong and continued growth is expected.  Patriot’s net interest margin was 3.75% for the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter, as compared to 3.85% in the prior quarter and 3.60% in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2015. Net interest income, before provision for loan losses, increased by $161,000 or 2.8%, as compared to the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2016, and $796,000 or 15.7% compared to the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2015. The continued increase in net interest income is the result of loan and deposit growth.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter, reflecting an increase in loan growth, was $150,000, as compared to $355,000 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2016 and zero for the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Non-interest income decreased by $44,000, or 10.7%, over last quarter and increased $24,000, or 7%, over the same period last year.   Non-interest expense declined $27,000, or 0.6%, over last quarter and by $194,000, or 4.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2016, shareholders’ equity was unchanged at $62.6 million, when compared to the prior quarter.  This was a direct result of stock repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program.   Shareholders’ equity was $61.5 million a year ago.  The Company’s book value per share increased to $16.08 at December 31, 2016, compared to $15. $15.80 at September 30, 2016 and $15.54 at December 31, 2015.</p>
<p>The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  As of December 31, 2016, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.52%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 11.18% and total risk based capital was 11.93%.</p>
