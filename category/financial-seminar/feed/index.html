				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 200 Housatonic Community College (HCC) and students from Central High School gained real-world financial insights and lessons from leaders at an interactive workshop designed to prepare them to secure their financial futures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2496 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students-300x199.jpg" alt="HCC Students" width="300" height="199" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students-300x199.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Students engaged in an interactive discussion, surveys and Q&amp;A on topics such as establishing smart spending practices, creating a financial plan, paying for student loans, saving on a limited budget, and diversifying investments.</p>
<p>The event, held during Financial Literacy Month in April, was sponsored by Patriot Bank as part of its mission to help educate the next generation on this critical topic. &#8220;Acquiring sound financial habits and making smart money decisions at a younger age will prove beneficial for a lifetime, helping young people secure their financial futures,” said <strong>Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus Jr.</strong> “Patriot Bank is encouraged that so many young people are being engaged in this topic and that Housatonic is supporting it through many initiatives, such as newly created coursework.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the key questions asked by participants, many of whom are beginning to make first-time money decisions as they gain financial independence were: <em>“How do I create a budget?” “Can I save money without a job?” “What financial advice can I ask from my parents?”</em></p>
<p><em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2497 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb-300x199.jpg" alt="HCC Dr. Pasierb" width="300" height="199" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb-300x199.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A survey by Patriot found that while 54% of Housatonic students are regularly saving, 46% are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Speakers included Mr. Muskus; <strong>Dr. Michael Brown</strong>, HCC’s Dean of Academic Affairs; <strong>Bernard Pasierb, </strong>HCC Instructor of Business Administration<strong>; Charles Mayrick, </strong>HCC Assistant Professor of Business and Economics; and <strong>Beverly Hoppie, </strong>Director of Education and Community Engagement at the Bridgeport Neighborhood Trust<strong>. Pam Pirog</strong>, HCC Professor of Entrepreneurship and Accounting, moderated the event.</p>

<p>“It was great to partner with Patriot Bank to offer the money management panel focused on financial literacy. Both the College and Patriot Bank place a high value on personal financial responsibility as a means for a successful life. We are committed to increasing financial awareness and literacy among diverse and emerging populations,” said <strong>Housatonic Community College President Dr. Paul Broadie. “</strong>Providing individuals with the tools and knowledge to understand and effectively manage their finances is essential. It is important for us to engage high school and college students in financial literacy education as it positions them to be good stewards of their finances. I look forward to future partnerships with Patriot Bank whose mission, like ours, places a keen focus on serving as a resource and addressing the needs of the community.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Beverly.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2499 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Beverly-300x199.jpg" alt="HCC Panelist Beverly Hoppie" width="300" height="199" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Beverly-300x199.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Beverly.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Panelists and participants both shared personal finance stories, as well as resources and tips, to help with financial planning and managing their current and future earnings and obligations. Housatonic and Patriot will present a second seminar in the fall semester as part of their collaboration in teaching financial literacy skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Housatonic is one of six community colleges in Connecticut to offer a personal finance course. It was added this year as a business elective class after Business Administration Professors Bernard Pasierb and Mary Ann Vlahac recognized significant student interest in gaining the knowledge and skills needed to make informed lifelong financial decisions. The course teaches money management, goal setting, budgeting, saving, taxes, consumer credit, automobiles, housing, insurance, investment vehicles, retirement and estate planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Brown.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2500 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Brown-300x199.jpg" alt="HCC Panelist Dr. Brown" width="300" height="199" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Brown-300x199.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Brown.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>A two-year state college, Housatonic specializes in offering STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) programs for students earning their Associate in Arts and Associates in Science degrees and helps them begin their careers. Its 9-month Advanced Manufacturing Program has achieved a 100% job placement success rate for graduates.</p>

<p>According to the federal Housing and Urban Development<a href="http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2016/02-2016/Gov__Malloy_Announces_Connecticut_Receives_Federal_Certification_of_Effectively_Eliminating_Veteran_Homelessness/"><sup>1</sup></a>, Connecticut is the second state to end veteran homelessness and is close to being the first state to end chronic homelessness, making it crucial that these impacted individuals acquire financial skills to build a more secure future.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, Patriot Bank, N.A. is providing complimentary financial literacy and counseling to veterans and others who receive help from Homes with Hope, a Westport-based non-profit providing shelter, permanent supportive housing, food and case management.</p>
<p>At Patriot’s 2<sup>nd</sup> annual event at Homes with Hope, over a dozen participants learned about managing money, credit and budgeting basics and began to create a viable plan to begin securing their financial futures. Topics included how to create a budget, open a bank account, establish short- and long-term savings plans, and establish and maintain credit.</p>
<p>The seminar was presented by 16-year banking industry veteran Monique Mason, Assistant Branch Manager at Patriot Bank in Westport.</p>
<p>“There are so many individuals who fall and remain victims to the vicious cycle of homelessness in part because they were never taught basic financial literacy,” said <strong>Ms. Mason.</strong> “Too often, their situation is exacerbated by taking out cash advances or payday loans, which come with high fees and exorbitant interest rates. Patriot bankers are working with some of these veterans and others to take steps to improve their own financial situations, beginning with opening a checking account without fees and considering credit card options towards eventually establishing better credit.”</p>

<p>Patriot Bank, N.A. is providing complimentary financial literacy and counseling to both youth and the nonprofit staff of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Northern Westchester (BGCNW). Patriot bankers visit the Club to provide personal finance education counseling, which is led by Andrew Fairchild, VP and Manager of Patriot Bank in Bedford.</p>
<p>“Financial illiteracy in America is rampant, especially among youth. Together with the Boys &amp; Girls Club, Patriot Bank wants to offer real world-style lessons on fiscal priorities and how to avoid costly mistakes that can damage an individual’s credit for many years into the future,” said Mr. Fairchild.</p>
<p>To further support this effort, Patriot has also donated funds to BGCNW, for Money Matters, a national Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America program that teaches fiscal lessons and skills to young adults. Through Money Matters, youth learn about the expected costs of college tuition, the costs of purchasing and maintaining a car, clothing and other life necessities. It is part of the organization’s College Quest, Job Ready and Junior Staff programs.</p>
<p>“The Boys &amp; Girls Club’s Money Matters program has been enhanced by our relationship with Patriot Bank, which offers financial information to our staff and teens, many of whom don’t have these resources at home. Many of our members will be the first in their family to graduate high school and enter college, so educational opportunities like these can have a tremendous impact,” said Barbara Cutri, Director of Program Operations at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Northern Westchester.</p>
<p>She continued, “Over the last 7 years, each teen from our program, including at-risk teens, have graduated high school and gone on to technical school, or a two- or four-year college. Now we will further empower youth with the financial literacy they will need to thrive.”</p>
<p>Some 20 participants attended Patriot’s most recent money management seminar. The discussion included:<br />
· Opening checking and savings accounts<br />
· Making deposits, writing checks and maintaining a checking account<br />
· Applying for student loans<br />
· Creating and meeting a college budget<br />
· Identifying best practices for using credit and credit cards<br />
· Determining when to use credit or save and pay cash</p>
<p>Participants included students of Fox Lane High School, Horace Greeley High School, John Jay High School and Somers High School.</p>
<p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Northern Westchester is a nonprofit organization that has been improving the lives of kids for more than 76 years by providing supervised recreation, physical instruction, educational, cultural and social programs to more than 1,200 youth annually from more than 40 Northern Westchester communities.</p>
