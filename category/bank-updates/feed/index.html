				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Patriot National Bancorp Net Income Breaks $1 Million Milestone </em></strong><strong><em>in the Third Quarter; Declares Quarterly Dividend  </em></strong></p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;  &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><em>Efforts yield significant 26% earnings climb, while assets increase to $826 million. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>CEO says, “We can do even better!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>STAMFORD, CT – October 31, 2017</strong> – Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot”, “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ: PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced another milestone achievement with quarterly pre-tax earnings of $1.7 million and quarterly net income exceeding $1.0 million, or $0.26 per fully diluted share.</p>
<p>The $1 million net income compares to net income of $804 thousand, $0.21 per fully diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017 and $814 thousand, $0.21 per share, for the same quarter a year ago.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 net income was $3.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with $885 thousand, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, for the corresponding 2016 period.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank’s deposits continued to rise and are now up 28% year-over-year, with loan growth of 5% for the quarter and 27% from the year prior, fueling a strong growth in net interest income.   Net interest income climbed 23% from the corresponding 2016 period and for 2017 is 14% higher than in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>In addition to the announcement of quarterly earnings, Patriot announced the declaration of its second consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.01 per fully diluted share.  The correct record date for this quarterly dividend is November 9, 2017, with a dividend payment date of November 10, 2017.</p>
<p>CEO <strong>Michael Carrazza</strong> stated: “This quarter’s milestone is further confirmation of the steady progress we expect to achieve from the operational disciplines put in place and management’s focus on growth and value accretion.  While pleased in reaching these milestones, content we are not.  Internal mandates have been set to materially beat third quarter performance and further enhance key operating metrics in the fourth quarter.  The expected closing of our acquisition of Prime Bank will further add to our earnings momentum.”</p>
<p>Announced last week, Prime Bank shareholders voted in favor of its merger with Patriot. As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $56 million in deposits and $28 million in total loans.  Closing is pending receipt of regulatory approvals, which is targeted before year-end.</p>
<p>Richard Muskus, Patriot’s President added, “We have created greater capacity to build a high quality loan portfolio, achieve critical mass in attractive product lines and enhance service offerings to our customers.  These are the primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value.”</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first nine months of 2016 and 2017 include the impact of a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Bank recorded a significant loan loss provision, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision, which primarily consisted of losses and recoveries related to this loan, net income for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2017 was 30% higher than the same period in 2016.  These results are the by-product of aggressive value-enhancing strategies that have been underway over the past year.</p>
<p>The strong earnings performance is attributable to significant loan growth, while operating expenses have remained under tight control.</p>
<p>In the year since September 30, 2016, total assets increased by $144 million (21%), up from $682 million.  Loans totaled $710 million as of September 30, 2017, up 5% from the $679 million reported June 30, 2017, and up 27% from the $560 million reported September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Deposits increased during the quarter to $605 million and were up 28% year-over-year as compared with $471 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot’s overall growth prospects.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $7.1 million in the quarter, up 12% from the second quarter 2017 and up 23% from the corresponding 2016 period.  Net interest income of $18.9 million in the year-to-date period was 14% higher than the $16.5 million in the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.65% for the quarter and 3.59% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.61 % in the prior quarter and 3.79% in the first nine months of 2016.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter was $545 thousand, reflecting the growth in loans with overall credit quality remaining strong.  The year-to-date credit in the provision of $944 thousand reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $355 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income was $386 thousand in the quarter, 10% higher than the prior quarter.  Year-to-date non-interest income of $1 million was 15% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the loss on security sales of $78 thousand recognized in the first quarter, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased 4%, over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased 7% over the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2017 shareholders’ equity was $66.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million from a year ago.  The Company’s book value per share increased to $17.02 at September 30, 2017 as compared to $15.80 a year ago.</p>
<p>The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  As of September 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.57%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.69% and total risk based capital was 11.55%.</p>

<p class="Glypha-Drop-Cap"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">F</span>or an institution that was once near the brink of collapse, Patriot National Bank has made an impressive comeback — and it’s not done yet, according to chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza.</p>
<p class="Body-text">“The bank has never been as profitable as it is today,” Carrazza said at his office in Patriot’s headquarters at 900 Bedford St. in Stamford. “We took an aggressive approach to turning it around and we will continue with that approach.”</p>
<p class="Body-text">Dividends have been coming fast and furious for Patriot over the past several months.</p>
<p class="Body-text">In August, it posted second-quarter pretax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804,000. Those are significant increases over the year-ago quarter’s pretax loss of $948,000 and net loss of $582,000. For the six months ended June 30, net income was $2.5 million, compared with $71,000 for the first half of 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot National Bancorp, parent company of Patriot Bank, continued its push into the New Haven County market Wednesday, announcing an agreement to acquire Prime Bank in Orange.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot Bank already has a branch office in Milford. But it is the Stamford-based bank’s only New Haven County location, so the acquisition of Prime Bank, which has only one branch, will increase Patriot Bank’s presence in southwestern New Haven County.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Full terms of the deal were not released, but the acquisition will be paid for in cash, according to Patriot National officials. The deal is subject to approval by Prime’s shareholders and banking regulators.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Patriot National officials said Prime shareholders will receive aggregate cash payment equal to 115 percent of Prime’s tangible book value as of the deal’s closing date, which is expected to occur sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Prime Bank’s tangible book value as of June 30 was approximately $9 million.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">“The acquisition of Prime Bank will support our operating goals of extending Patriot Bank’s footprint, building scale, and improving key operating metrics, all of which ultimately adds value for our shareholders and customers,” Michael Carrazza, Patriot chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Jasper Jaser, Prime’s chief executive officer, said the deal “meets the objectives of our shareholders, customers and employees.” Officials with both banks did not provide information regarding the number of employees that Prime has.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">“Our customers will benefit from increased services and expanded product and lending capabilities,” Jaser said in a statement.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">John Carusone, president of the Bank Analysis Center, a Hartford-based industry consulting firm, said the acquisition of Prime continues Patriot Bank’s rise from near financial ruin in 2010.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">It was founded in 1994 by Fred DeCaro Jr., who was a principal in several Westchester County automobile dealerships, according to Carusone. But a series of bad loans that were made to luxury home developers nearly ruined the bank after Connecticut’s market for expensive real estate took a nosedive during the last recession, he said.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.5pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">Carrazza, a former Goldman Sachs executive, stepped in with an investor group and recapitalized Patriot National with $60 million. Then Carrazza and his fellow investors bought out the bank shareholders “for pennies on the dollar,” according to Carusone.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot” or the “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:<a href="https://globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=PNBK&amp;exchange=2">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), and Prime Bank headquartered in Orange, CT (“Prime”) (PMHV:US) jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Patriot will acquire Prime. The acquisition will expand Patriot’s community banking presence and footprint in Southern Connecticut.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $55.8 million in deposits and $27.8 million in total loans.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement Prime shareholders will receive aggregate cash consideration equal to 115% of Prime’s tangible book value as of the closing date. The acquisition will result in a new Patriot branch located in the Town of Orange, in New Haven County.  The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter 2017 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and Prime shareholder approval.</p>
<p><strong>Patriot Chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza</strong> stated<strong>,</strong> “The acquisition of Prime Bank will support our operating goals of extending Patriot Bank’s footprint, building scale, and improving key operating metrics, all of which ultimately adds value for our shareholders and customers.”</p>
<p><strong>Richard Muskus Jr.</strong>, Patriot’s President, added, “The acquisition will enable Patriot Bank to expand its consumer and small business relationships, lending operations, and community presence, while offering Prime’s current customers a broader suite of products.”</p>
<p>In the second fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported pre-tax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804 thousand, or $0.21 per diluted share.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income was $2.5 million or $0.65 per diluted share.  In July 2017, Patriot announced the reinstatement of its dividend policy and declared its first quarterly dividend for shareholders since 2008.</p>
<p>Patriot anticipates that Prime’s branch staff will join Patriot to assist in a seamless transition and continue to help drive growth efforts and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Prime CEO Jasper J. Jaser</strong> stated, “We are pleased to announce this transaction, as we believe merging into Patriot meets the objectives of our shareholders, customers and employees.  Our customers will benefit from increased services and expanded product and lending capabilities; our branch employees will be part of a larger organization and branch network, offering broader career opportunities.”</p>
<p><strong>Paul Lutsky, Prime’s Vice President</strong>, added, “The merger will support Patriot’s growth strategies, allowing it to leverage its larger capital base and legal lending limits to provide broader lending solutions to Prime’s customers.”</p>
<p>Prime Bank shareholders will receive detailed information about the transaction in a proxy statement that will be sent to them in connection with a special shareholders’ meeting to approve the transaction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Patriot&#8221;, &#8220;Bancorp&#8221;) (NASDAQ:<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/pnbk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), today announced another quarter of powerful earnings momentum, reporting second quarter pre-tax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804 thousand, or $0.21 per diluted share.</p>
<p>This compares to net income of $1.7 million, $0.44 per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and a reported loss of $582 thousand for the same quarter a year ago.   For the six months ended June 30, 2017 net income was $2.5 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with $71 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first six months of 2016 and 2017 were affected by a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved.  In the first half of 2016, the Bank took significant loan loss provisions, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision (which primarily included loan losses and recoveries related to this loan), Patriot&#8217;s second quarter net income was up 42% from the first quarter of 2017, and net income for the six-month period ending June 30, 2017 was 28% higher than the same period in 2016.  These results are the by-product of aggressive value-enhancing strategies that have been underway over the past year.</p>
<p>Strong earnings performance is attributable to loan and deposit growth, while operating expenses have remained under tight control.  Compared to a year ago, loans increased 28% while deposits increased 26%, fueling the strong growth in net interest income.</p>
<p><strong>CEO Michael Carrazza stated:</strong> &#8220;This quarter&#8217;s impressive results are directly attributable to the enhancements we have made in management and operations.  We expect this positive trend to continue as we prioritize high-impact strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carrazza took over operational control of Patriot as interim CEO in August 2016 to execute a series of value-enhancing strategies and to reposition the executive team.  The performance in the past four quarters reflects an intensive and carefully planned strategy to drive profitability and shareholder value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initiatives to increase scale, build critical mass in attractive product lines and improve deposit funding channels are primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value,&#8221; added <strong>Mr. Carrazza.</strong></p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, total assets were $773 million, essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter, when they had increased by $18 million.  In the year since June 30, 2016, total assets increased by $121 million, up from $652 million.  Loans totaled $679 million as of June 30, 2017, up 8% from the $631 million reported March 31, 2017, and up 28% from the $529 million reported June 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Deposits remained essentially unchanged during the quarter at $562 million and were up 26% year-over-year as compared with $446 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot&#8217;s overall growth prospects. The loan pipeline remains strong and continued growth is expected.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 14% from the first quarter 2017 and up 17% from the corresponding 2016 period, reflecting strong loan and deposit growth.  Net interest income of $11.8 million in the year-to-date period was 9% higher than the $10.8 million in the six month period ending June 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.61% for the quarter and 3.56% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.50% in the prior quarter and 3.77% in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter was $260 thousand, reflecting the growth in loans with overall credit quality remaining strong.  The year-to-date credit in the provision of $1.5 million reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $2.0 million in both the second quarter and year-to-date periods in 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income was $349 thousand in the quarter, 26% higher than the prior quarter.  The prior quarter includes a loss on the sale of investment securities of $78 thousand.  Year-to-date non-interest income of $626 thousand was 19% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the loss on security sales recognized in the first quarter, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased 7%, over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased 2% over the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017 shareholders&#8217; equity was $65.3 million, an increase of $3.4 million from a year ago.  The Company&#8217;s book value per share increased to $16.77 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $15.64 a year ago.</p>
<p>The Bank&#8217;s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory status.  As of June 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.97%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.73% and total risk based capital was 11.59%.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph D. Perillo has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. and Patriot Bank, N.A. Mr. Perillo was brought on by the Board of Directors on January 3, 2017 as a senior executive consultant, tasked with assessing the finance department’s processes and improving operations and internal controls. He has been instrumental in developing multiple earnings improvement strategies, which have already proved beneficial.</p>
<p>He began in public accounting with KPMG and then 20 years in banking with Citibank, NatWest and later as Senior Vice President &amp; Controller for GreenPoint Financial then one of the 50 largest banking companies in the U.S. Over the past 12 years he has served as Chief Accounting Officer and Chief Financial Officer for iQor Inc., a $1.5 billion global leader in business process outsourcing.</p>
<p>“Joe’s deep financial and banking acumen will benefit the institution greatly as Patriot Bank quickly moves up its peer group rankings. Since Joe’s arrival in January, he has become an integral force in the development and execution of our strategies for profit improvement and growth. The impact of his contributions already appear in our first quarter results,” said Mr. Carrazza.</p>
<p>Mr. Perillo’s appointment follows another step in Patriot’s executive leadership rebuilding. In August of 2016, Mr. Carrazza, the bank’s Chairman and veteran private equity operating financier, took over as Interim CEO to lead a process of rapidly improving profitability, productivity, operations and transforming the bank’s management team.</p>
<p>In February the bank promoted Richard A. Muskus, Jr. to become President.  He was previously the bank’s EVP &amp; Chief Lending Officer. Prior to that it announced the promotion of other senior managers: Judith Corprew as EVP-Chief Compliance &amp; Risk Officer; Christopher Johnson as SVP–Director of Branch Banking; and Laura Holleran as SVP-Director of Retail Operations &amp; Security Officer. This senior leadership team has contributed greatly to the outstanding financial performance that Patriot Bank has delivered in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Mr. Perillo earned his B.S. in accounting from St. John’s University and is a Certified Public Accountant. He lives in Hempstead, NY with his family.</p>
