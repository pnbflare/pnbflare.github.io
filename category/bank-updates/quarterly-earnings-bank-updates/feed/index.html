				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Patriot National Bancorp Net Income Breaks $1 Million Milestone </em></strong><strong><em>in the Third Quarter; Declares Quarterly Dividend  </em></strong></p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;  &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><em>Efforts yield significant 26% earnings climb, while assets increase to $826 million. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>CEO says, “We can do even better!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>STAMFORD, CT – October 31, 2017</strong> – Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot”, “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ: PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced another milestone achievement with quarterly pre-tax earnings of $1.7 million and quarterly net income exceeding $1.0 million, or $0.26 per fully diluted share.</p>
<p>The $1 million net income compares to net income of $804 thousand, $0.21 per fully diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017 and $814 thousand, $0.21 per share, for the same quarter a year ago.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 net income was $3.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with $885 thousand, or $0.22 per fully diluted share, for the corresponding 2016 period.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank’s deposits continued to rise and are now up 28% year-over-year, with loan growth of 5% for the quarter and 27% from the year prior, fueling a strong growth in net interest income.   Net interest income climbed 23% from the corresponding 2016 period and for 2017 is 14% higher than in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>In addition to the announcement of quarterly earnings, Patriot announced the declaration of its second consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.01 per fully diluted share.  The correct record date for this quarterly dividend is November 9, 2017, with a dividend payment date of November 10, 2017.</p>
<p>CEO <strong>Michael Carrazza</strong> stated: “This quarter’s milestone is further confirmation of the steady progress we expect to achieve from the operational disciplines put in place and management’s focus on growth and value accretion.  While pleased in reaching these milestones, content we are not.  Internal mandates have been set to materially beat third quarter performance and further enhance key operating metrics in the fourth quarter.  The expected closing of our acquisition of Prime Bank will further add to our earnings momentum.”</p>
<p>Announced last week, Prime Bank shareholders voted in favor of its merger with Patriot. As of June 30, 2017, Prime had approximately $73 million in total assets, $56 million in deposits and $28 million in total loans.  Closing is pending receipt of regulatory approvals, which is targeted before year-end.</p>
<p>Richard Muskus, Patriot’s President added, “We have created greater capacity to build a high quality loan portfolio, achieve critical mass in attractive product lines and enhance service offerings to our customers.  These are the primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value.”</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first nine months of 2016 and 2017 include the impact of a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Bank recorded a significant loan loss provision, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision, which primarily consisted of losses and recoveries related to this loan, net income for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2017 was 30% higher than the same period in 2016.  These results are the by-product of aggressive value-enhancing strategies that have been underway over the past year.</p>
<p>The strong earnings performance is attributable to significant loan growth, while operating expenses have remained under tight control.</p>
<p>In the year since September 30, 2016, total assets increased by $144 million (21%), up from $682 million.  Loans totaled $710 million as of September 30, 2017, up 5% from the $679 million reported June 30, 2017, and up 27% from the $560 million reported September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Deposits increased during the quarter to $605 million and were up 28% year-over-year as compared with $471 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot’s overall growth prospects.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $7.1 million in the quarter, up 12% from the second quarter 2017 and up 23% from the corresponding 2016 period.  Net interest income of $18.9 million in the year-to-date period was 14% higher than the $16.5 million in the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.65% for the quarter and 3.59% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.61 % in the prior quarter and 3.79% in the first nine months of 2016.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter was $545 thousand, reflecting the growth in loans with overall credit quality remaining strong.  The year-to-date credit in the provision of $944 thousand reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $355 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income was $386 thousand in the quarter, 10% higher than the prior quarter.  Year-to-date non-interest income of $1 million was 15% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the loss on security sales of $78 thousand recognized in the first quarter, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased 4%, over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased 7% over the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2017 shareholders’ equity was $66.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million from a year ago.  The Company’s book value per share increased to $17.02 at September 30, 2017 as compared to $15.80 a year ago.</p>
<p>The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  As of September 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.57%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.69% and total risk based capital was 11.55%.</p>

<p class="Glypha-Drop-Cap"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">F</span>or an institution that was once near the brink of collapse, Patriot National Bank has made an impressive comeback — and it’s not done yet, according to chairman and CEO Michael Carrazza.</p>
<p class="Body-text">“The bank has never been as profitable as it is today,” Carrazza said at his office in Patriot’s headquarters at 900 Bedford St. in Stamford. “We took an aggressive approach to turning it around and we will continue with that approach.”</p>
<p class="Body-text">Dividends have been coming fast and furious for Patriot over the past several months.</p>
<p class="Body-text">In August, it posted second-quarter pretax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804,000. Those are significant increases over the year-ago quarter’s pretax loss of $948,000 and net loss of $582,000. For the six months ended June 30, net income was $2.5 million, compared with $71,000 for the first half of 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Patriot&#8221;, &#8220;Bancorp&#8221;) (NASDAQ:<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/pnbk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), today announced another quarter of powerful earnings momentum, reporting second quarter pre-tax income of $1.4 million and net income of $804 thousand, or $0.21 per diluted share.</p>
<p>This compares to net income of $1.7 million, $0.44 per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and a reported loss of $582 thousand for the same quarter a year ago.   For the six months ended June 30, 2017 net income was $2.5 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with $71 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>The comparative results for the first six months of 2016 and 2017 were affected by a troubled loan that was ultimately resolved.  In the first half of 2016, the Bank took significant loan loss provisions, but aggressively worked towards a recovery, which was successfully accomplished in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of the loan loss provision (which primarily included loan losses and recoveries related to this loan), Patriot&#8217;s second quarter net income was up 42% from the first quarter of 2017, and net income for the six-month period ending June 30, 2017 was 28% higher than the same period in 2016.  These results are the by-product of aggressive value-enhancing strategies that have been underway over the past year.</p>
<p>Strong earnings performance is attributable to loan and deposit growth, while operating expenses have remained under tight control.  Compared to a year ago, loans increased 28% while deposits increased 26%, fueling the strong growth in net interest income.</p>
<p><strong>CEO Michael Carrazza stated:</strong> &#8220;This quarter&#8217;s impressive results are directly attributable to the enhancements we have made in management and operations.  We expect this positive trend to continue as we prioritize high-impact strategies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carrazza took over operational control of Patriot as interim CEO in August 2016 to execute a series of value-enhancing strategies and to reposition the executive team.  The performance in the past four quarters reflects an intensive and carefully planned strategy to drive profitability and shareholder value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initiatives to increase scale, build critical mass in attractive product lines and improve deposit funding channels are primary areas of focus and will continue to add to our profitability and franchise value,&#8221; added <strong>Mr. Carrazza.</strong></p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, total assets were $773 million, essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter, when they had increased by $18 million.  In the year since June 30, 2016, total assets increased by $121 million, up from $652 million.  Loans totaled $679 million as of June 30, 2017, up 8% from the $631 million reported March 31, 2017, and up 28% from the $529 million reported June 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Deposits remained essentially unchanged during the quarter at $562 million and were up 26% year-over-year as compared with $446 million at the end of the second quarter of 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot&#8217;s overall growth prospects. The loan pipeline remains strong and continued growth is expected.</p>
<p>Net interest income was $6.3 million in the quarter, up 14% from the first quarter 2017 and up 17% from the corresponding 2016 period, reflecting strong loan and deposit growth.  Net interest income of $11.8 million in the year-to-date period was 9% higher than the $10.8 million in the six month period ending June 30, 2016.  Net interest margin was 3.61% for the quarter and 3.56% for the 2017 year-to-date period, as compared to 3.50% in the prior quarter and 3.77% in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter was $260 thousand, reflecting the growth in loans with overall credit quality remaining strong.  The year-to-date credit in the provision of $1.5 million reflects the previously noted recovery. The provision for loan losses was $2.0 million in both the second quarter and year-to-date periods in 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income was $349 thousand in the quarter, 26% higher than the prior quarter.  The prior quarter includes a loss on the sale of investment securities of $78 thousand.  Year-to-date non-interest income of $626 thousand was 19% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the loss on security sales recognized in the first quarter, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased 7%, over the prior quarter and year-to-date non-interest expenses increased 2% over the same period in 2016.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017 shareholders&#8217; equity was $65.3 million, an increase of $3.4 million from a year ago.  The Company&#8217;s book value per share increased to $16.77 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $15.64 a year ago.</p>
<p>The Bank&#8217;s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; regulatory status.  As of June 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.97%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 10.73% and total risk based capital was 11.59%.</p>

Also, at the end of 2016, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion dollar milestone and continued to demonstrate growth in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">First quarter earnings also increased over the prior quarter by 66%.  For comparison to prior quarterly periods, the third quarter of 2016 saw $814,000 in net income, or $0.21 per diluted share, while in the fourth quarter Patriot reported $1,045,000 in net income, or $0.27 per share. The current quarter results include the impact of a substantial recovery of a loan that was charged-off last year.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">As of March 31, 2017, total assets increased to $775 million, as compared to $757 million at December 31, 2016 and $636 million at March 31, 2016.  Net loans totaled $625 million, up 8% over $577 million as of December 31, 2016, and up 30% over $480 million at March 31, 2016.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">Deposits grew 6%, or $32 million, to $561 million at March 31, 2017 as compared to $529 million at December 31, 2016 and $424 million at March 31 2016.  Deposit growth remains a key initiative to keep pace with Patriot’s overall growth prospects. Patriot has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32% over the last year.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">CEO<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><strong>Michael Carrazza</strong><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>stated: “Patriot’s recent jump in performance is a direct result of performance enhancing strategies that we designed and began implementing in the third quarter 2016.  The amalgamation of broad-based operational improvements, management changes, asset-class repositioning, and balance sheet reengineering are producing these very positive results, and they remain ongoing.  Tackled in this quarter was the successful recovery of a charged-off loan that had been paralyzed in a protracted legal process.  Our initiatives support a steady, predictable earnings trend, and our increasing scale will further drive efficiencies.”</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">Mr. Carrazza took operational control of Patriot as interim CEO in August 2016 to execute a series of value-enhancing strategies and to reposition the executive team.  The performance in the past three quarters reflects a keenly focused and regimented effort to drive profitability and shareholder value.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">“Patriot’s banking platform is on a solid earnings trajectory, which improves each day.  Shareholders should benefit from increasing scale, profitability and strategic activities that are intently underway,” added Mr. Carrazza.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">The loan pipeline remains strong and continued growth is expected.  Patriot’s net interest margin was 3.50% for the first quarter, as compared to 3.75% in the prior quarter and 3.76% in the first quarter of 2016. Net interest income decreased by $343,000, or 6%, as compared to the 4th quarter of 2016, and increased by $109,000, or 2%, compared to the 1<sup><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">st</span></sup>  quarter of 2016.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">The decline from the fourth quarter reflects the full quarter impact of interest paid on long-term senior debt issued in December of 2016 and also reflects a timing mis-match between loan attrition early in the quarter and new loans that closed late in the quarter.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;">The provision for loan losses in the quarter was a net credit of $1,749,000, reflecting the previously noted recovery, partially offset by a $1.1 million addition to the Allowance for Loan Loss to reflect the growth in the end of period loan balance. The provision for loan losses was $150,000 in the 4<sup><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">th</span></sup><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>quarter of 2016 and zero in the 1<sup><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">st</span></sup><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>Non-interest income decreased by $91,000 or 25%, over last quarter and $133,000, or 32%, below the same period last year.  Both comparisons were impacted by a loss of $78,000 recognized on the sale of investment portfolio securities, as the portfolio was intentionally re-positioned to provide future enhancements to profitability.</p>
<p>Non-interest expense increased $280,000, or 6%, over last quarter and declined by $70,000, or 1% compared to the 1<sup><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">st</span></sup><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2017 shareholders’ equity was $64.4 million, an increase of $1.8 million over December 31, 2016, at $62.6 million. This was a direct result of the reported net income of the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s book value per share increased to $16.55 at March 31, 2017 as compared to $16.08 at December 31, 2016 and $15.75 at March 31, 2016.<br />
The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  As of March 31, 2017 Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.65%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 11.09% and total risk based capital was 11.96%.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pnbk" target="_blank">PNBK</a>), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A., today reported a 28% increase in 4<sup>th</sup> quarter earnings compared to the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter, with net income of $1,045,000 or $0.27 diluted income per share.  This nearly doubles the net income a year ago, which was $532,000, or $0.14 diluted income per share. In the 3<sup>rd </sup>quarter of 2016, Patriot reported a healthy rise in net income of $814,000, or $0.21 diluted income per share.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $74 million (nearly 11%) to $757 million, as compared to $683 million at September 30, 2016 and $653 million at December 31, 2015.  Net loans, up 4%, totaled $577 million as of December 31, 2016 compared to $553 million at September 30, 2016 and $479 million at December 31, 2015.</p>
<p>Deposits grew 12% or $58 million to $529 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to $471 million at September 30, 2016 and $445 million at December 31, 2015.  Deposit growth was one of the key initiatives launched in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter and continued through December 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Recent management changes and operational initiatives have contributed to Patriot’s notable boost in profitability over the last two quarters.</p>
<p>“Patriot’s performance, achieving 29% earnings growth in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter and 28% earnings growth in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter is a direct result of ongoing performance enhancing strategies being executed by our team,” said Michael Carrazza.  “These results evidence the effectiveness of our strategies.”</p>
<p>Mr. Carrazza took operational control of Patriot, as interim CEO, in August 2016 to carry out a series of value-enhancing strategies and to reposition the executive team.  In January 2017, Mr. Richard Muskus was internally promoted to President and Mr. Joseph Perillo was retained as a senior financial advisor to assist in the execution of performance improvement initiatives. “We expect these enhancements to contribute to a steady increase in franchise value,” added Mr. Carrazza.</p>
<p>The loan pipeline remains strong and continued growth is expected.  Patriot’s net interest margin was 3.75% for the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter, as compared to 3.85% in the prior quarter and 3.60% in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2015. Net interest income, before provision for loan losses, increased by $161,000 or 2.8%, as compared to the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2016, and $796,000 or 15.7% compared to the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2015. The continued increase in net interest income is the result of loan and deposit growth.</p>
<p>The provision for loan losses in the quarter, reflecting an increase in loan growth, was $150,000, as compared to $355,000 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2016 and zero for the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Non-interest income decreased by $44,000, or 10.7%, over last quarter and increased $24,000, or 7%, over the same period last year.   Non-interest expense declined $27,000, or 0.6%, over last quarter and by $194,000, or 4.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2016, shareholders’ equity was unchanged at $62.6 million, when compared to the prior quarter.  This was a direct result of stock repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program.   Shareholders’ equity was $61.5 million a year ago.  The Company’s book value per share increased to $16.08 at December 31, 2016, compared to $15. $15.80 at September 30, 2016 and $15.54 at December 31, 2015.</p>
<p>The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  As of December 31, 2016, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.52%, Tier 1 risk based capital was 11.18% and total risk based capital was 11.93%.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patriot Bank parent company Patriot National Bancorp Inc. reported a nearly 30 percent increase in third-quarter earnings with net income of $814,000 or 21 cents diluted income per share. The result compared favorably with last year’s third-quarter figures of $633,000 net income or 16 cents diluted income per share, and with second-quarter 2016’s $582,000 net loss or -15 cents diluted income per share.</p>
<p>For the quarter ending Sept. 30, total assets increased by $31 million, or nearly 5 percent, to $683 million, compared with $652 million on June 30, 2016, and $641 million on Sept. 30, 2015. Net loans totaled $553 million, up 6 percent, on Sept. 30, 2016 compared with $521 million on June 30, 2016 and $491 million on Sept. 30, 2015. Deposits also grew 5.6 percent, an increase of $25 million over the quarter.</p>
<p>Stamford-based Patriot credited the results in part to its chairman, Michael Carrazza, who took over as CEO after the August resignation of Kenneth Neilson from that role.</p>
<p>“Our team developed and began implementing initiatives aimed at generating stronger and consistent economic performance, which already proved visible this quarter,” Carrazza said. “These value-based, re-engineering disciplines made an immediate difference and are expected to further elevate operating efficiencies and bottom line results. We are looking to make continued strides going forward.”</p>
