				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 200 Housatonic Community College (HCC) and students from Central High School gained real-world financial insights and lessons from leaders at an interactive workshop designed to prepare them to secure their financial futures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2496 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students-300x199.jpg" alt="HCC Students" width="300" height="199" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students-300x199.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Students.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Students engaged in an interactive discussion, surveys and Q&amp;A on topics such as establishing smart spending practices, creating a financial plan, paying for student loans, saving on a limited budget, and diversifying investments.</p>
<p>The event, held during Financial Literacy Month in April, was sponsored by Patriot Bank as part of its mission to help educate the next generation on this critical topic. &#8220;Acquiring sound financial habits and making smart money decisions at a younger age will prove beneficial for a lifetime, helping young people secure their financial futures,” said <strong>Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus Jr.</strong> “Patriot Bank is encouraged that so many young people are being engaged in this topic and that Housatonic is supporting it through many initiatives, such as newly created coursework.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the key questions asked by participants, many of whom are beginning to make first-time money decisions as they gain financial independence were: <em>“How do I create a budget?” “Can I save money without a job?” “What financial advice can I ask from my parents?”</em></p>
<p><em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2497 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb-300x199.jpg" alt="HCC Dr. Pasierb" width="300" height="199" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb-300x199.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/HCC-Dr.-Pasierb.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A survey by Patriot found that while 54% of Housatonic students are regularly saving, 46% are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Speakers included Mr. Muskus; <strong>Dr. Michael Brown</strong>, HCC’s Dean of Academic Affairs; <strong>Bernard Pasierb, </strong>HCC Instructor of Business Administration<strong>; Charles Mayrick, </strong>HCC Assistant Professor of Business and Economics; and <strong>Beverly Hoppie, </strong>Director of Education and Community Engagement at the Bridgeport Neighborhood Trust<strong>. Pam Pirog</strong>, HCC Professor of Entrepreneurship and Accounting, moderated the event.</p>

<p>“It was great to partner with Patriot Bank to offer the money management panel focused on financial literacy. Both the College and Patriot Bank place a high value on personal financial responsibility as a means for a successful life. We are committed to increasing financial awareness and literacy among diverse and emerging populations,” said <strong>Housatonic Community College President Dr. Paul Broadie. “</strong>Providing individuals with the tools and knowledge to understand and effectively manage their finances is essential. It is important for us to engage high school and college students in financial literacy education as it positions them to be good stewards of their finances. I look forward to future partnerships with Patriot Bank whose mission, like ours, places a keen focus on serving as a resource and addressing the needs of the community.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Panelists and participants both shared personal finance stories, as well as resources and tips, to help with financial planning and managing their current and future earnings and obligations. Housatonic and Patriot will present a second seminar in the fall semester as part of their collaboration in teaching financial literacy skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Housatonic is one of six community colleges in Connecticut to offer a personal finance course. It was added this year as a business elective class after Business Administration Professors Bernard Pasierb and Mary Ann Vlahac recognized significant student interest in gaining the knowledge and skills needed to make informed lifelong financial decisions. The course teaches money management, goal setting, budgeting, saving, taxes, consumer credit, automobiles, housing, insurance, investment vehicles, retirement and estate planning.</p>

<p>A two-year state college, Housatonic specializes in offering STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) programs for students earning their Associate in Arts and Associates in Science degrees and helps them begin their careers. Its 9-month Advanced Manufacturing Program has achieved a 100% job placement success rate for graduates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Westchester youth are gaining some much-needed financial skills, learning to balance budgets, build credit, pay for college, and save for retirement with money lessons and insight from local experts</p>
<p>Mount Vernon Mayor Richard Thomas recently joined 100 students at Mount Vernon High School to help them plan for their financial independence in adulthood. Teens learned best practices for saving money, building credit, buying a home or car, saving for college and retirement, and investing during an interactive discussion with Patriot Bank EVP Judith Corprew, Mount Vernon Chamber of Commerce VP Rey Hollingsworth, and Northwestern Mutual Financial Advisors Brad Reid and Larry Kennedy.</p>
<p><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MVHS-4.2017.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2491 size-medium alignright" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MVHS-4.2017-300x200.jpg" alt="Mount Vernon High School Financial Literacy Seminar" width="300" height="200" align="right" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MVHS-4.2017-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MVHS-4.2017-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MVHS-4.2017.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Nearly half of Americans lack basic financial literacy, and many young people are not being educated on this crucial topic, according to a <a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/white-paper/commitment-financial-literacy-2017/" target="_blank">new report</a> from Patriot Bank, N.A. Overall, 43% of U.S. adults lack a basic understanding of financial skills, including proficiency in simple concepts of saving, investing, and debt, according to the report.</p>
<p>“Knowledge is power. This is why I’m proud of the work we’ve done to teach financial literacy to the youth of Mount Vernon. Most mistakes with managing money happen right after high school graduation. That is why it is so important for us to empower young adults with the knowledge to protect themselves from committing avoidable costly errors, which can stop their future. Starting early in educating young people about fiscal responsibility will create more possibilities for long-term prosperity,” said <strong>Mayor Richard Thomas.</strong></p>
<p>“Financial literacy is critical at every stage of life and can play a huge role in helping to determine your future,” said <strong>Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus, Jr. </strong>“That is why Patriot Bank is partnering with local schools and community organizations to help empower the next generation with the tools and resources they need to make smarter financial decisions.”</p>

About 20 young adults learned how to create a budget, use credit wisely and commit to a savings plan in the two-part seminar led by Patriot Bank Vice President Kathleen Reilly.</p>
<p>The bank is also providing a complimentary web-based financial literacy program, Banzai, to local schools, including Graham Elementary School, Mount Vernon High School, Thornton High School, Port Chestor Senior High School, White Plains Senior High School, Lincoln High School, and Yonkers Middle School.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank’s report <em>Commitment to Financial Literacy 2017</em> emphasizes the importance of teaching financial literacy and helps identify opportunities for young people to acquire the financial skills that will help better secure their future. It outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>What financial literacy is and its lifelong importance</li>
<li>Financial literacy impacts on everyday life</li>
<li>Why financial literacy education in New York was graded “B”</li>
<li>Free resources &amp; educational tools for educators and parents</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Jan Ursone, President at Junior Achievement of Southwest Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Young people today will likely need to make even more financial decisions than their parents did, yet unfortunately all too many simply lack the skills and knowledge to make informed choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TCHS-Team-evaluates-graphs.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2473 size-medium alignright" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TCHS-Team-evaluates-graphs-300x225.jpg" alt="Trinity Catholic High School students evaluate stock graphs" width="300" height="225" align="right" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TCHS-Team-evaluates-graphs-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TCHS-Team-evaluates-graphs-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/TCHS-Team-evaluates-graphs-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>For the last several years, Junior Achievement of Southwest Connecticut has hosted an annual Stock Market Challenge. In this financial learning simulation, every 60 seconds represents a day of trading on the stock market. Each team of local high school students has $500,000 of virtual cash to buy or sell shares in 26 public companies, from a biotechnology company producing water filtration systems, to a corporation that franchises and operates sandwich shops.</p>
<p>This year’s competition has expanded to include 44 teams and nearly 200 high school students from Trinity Catholic High School, Academy of Information Technology &amp; Engineering (AITE), King School, New Canaan High School, Westhill High School, and St. Luke’s School, thanks to the generosity of Patriot Bank, N.A. our title sponsor, and other civic-minded local companies.</p>
<p>The winning team from King School grew their half-a-million virtual dollars by 85 percent, reaching a net worth of $923,602.47 over the mock 60-day trading period. Close behind was a team from AITE, which grew their portfolio by 79 percent to $896,792.67.</p>
<p>Interactive learning events such as the Junior Achievement Stock Market Challenge encourage youth to practice financial decision-making and learn about taking on financial risks. A parent from Trinity said his son excitedly began a discussion at home about how engaged they were, the way stock markets operate and how to begin investing. That is the type of measurable result we should all want.</p>
<p>By translating the framework of financial literacy into such real-world experience, teens can learn early on important lessons like savings and investment strategies and the consequences of making decisions based on financial value — all while having fun!</p>
<p>April’s Financial Literacy Month serves as an ideal opportunity to begin teaching our next generation better real-world financial accountability. We as community leaders must all take this role very seriously. Here’s why:</p>
<p>According to a new Junior Achievement study, almost three in four teens (70 percent) don’t even know what a 401K is.</p>
<p>We also found that half of teens receive an allowance, a practical way to teach responsible money management and budgeting; however, 62 percent prefer using cash to pay for items despite modern day cashless technologies — smart phones, debit cards and online payment services.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Matthew Buchkowski knows tuition won’t be his only expense when he goes to college in a few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">College students usually also have to pay for university fees, room and board, transportation, books, supplies, food,</span> cellphone <span style="color: #000000;">bills and numerous other personal expenses, including haircuts, laundry — the list goes on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With that in mind, learning how to use his money and potential loans is crucial, the Trinity Catholic High School senior said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“It’s definitely something I want to know how to manage,” he said. “Money is overall very complex. It’s something that I want to get a good grasp on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Buchkowski joined a recent workshop on college loans held at Trinity as part of Financial Literacy Month.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The series, a Patriot Bank initiative, comes weeks after the company released an alarming report showing that nearly half of Americans lack basic financial literacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1356-e1493387180501.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2476 aligncenter" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1356-e1493387180501.jpg" alt="IMG_1356" width="500" height="375" align="&quot;center/" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The news is even worse for Connecticut, where high schools don’t require personal finance classes. The report gives the state an “F” in providing financial literacy education.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Personally, I feel like this course should be an elective that kids can actually take it in school,”</span> Buchkowski<span style="color: #000000;"> said. “But any class is better than none.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The goal of the four-part series, which also tackled budgeting and credit, is for high school students to learn how to better manage their money and prevent them from falling into the college loan trap.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“We’re raising scholars, the next generation, but we’re not giving them the tools within the school system to balance check books, to learn how to make deposits, to save for a rainy day, to do big investments,” <strong>said Judith Corprew, an executive vice president at Patriot Bank</strong> and one of the bankers who taught the series at Trinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1369.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2477" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1369.jpg" alt="IMG_1369" width="500" height="375" align="&quot;center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1369.jpg 4032w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1369-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1369-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_1369-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">An 18-country assessment by the Organization for Economic Cooperations shows that nearly 20 percent of American teenagers are not proficient in financial literacy. The issue has gained more attention as government-owned student loans top $1 trillion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thomas Butler, a Trinity parent who helped connect the school with Patriot’s financial literacy program, said more needs to be done to reduce students’ financial burden when they’re in college.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“When kids in school these days are not being taught about the basic metrics of the value of a dime, the value of an hour of labor and if you want to buy that nice new car or pay for college, they will look at you and say, ‘Oh so what? I’ll come out of college with a $50,000 in debt. It’s no big deal,’” Butler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“They don’t know what it’s going to cost to pay that back,” he said. “That’s why this program is so critical.”</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>Patriot Bank EVP-Chief Credit Officer Samuel Davis, left, and President Richard Muskus Jr., right, with the winning team from King School</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The familiar ring of the stock market opening bell kicked off the trading day for nearly 200 Fairfield County high school students, who tested their trading and investing mettle at the 2017 Stock Market Challenge, offered by Junior Achievement of Southwest Connecticut (JASWCT).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Students from Trinity Catholic High School, Academy of Information Technology &amp; Engineering (AITE), King School, New Canaan High School, Westhill High School, and St. Luke’s School comprised 44 teams at the third annual competition on Tuesday, April 25 at King School.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This year’s winning team, “VIP 5” from King School, grew their half-a-million virtual dollars by 85%, reaching a net worth of $923,602.47 over the mock 60-day trading period. Close behind was team “AKVD” from AITE, which earned the second highest portfolio value. Students bought and sold stocks – with one minute equaling one day – during the hour-long competition based on their quick analyses of earnings and profits, </span>value<span style="color: #000000;"> and risk, using their financial acumen to maximize their investments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2472" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AITE-second-place-team.jpg" alt="AITE Came in Second Place" width="394" height="296" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AITE-second-place-team.jpg 4032w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AITE-second-place-team-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AITE-second-place-team-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AITE-second-place-team-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /><small></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was part of an initiative to increase financial literacy among young people, helping them to develop skills to evaluate debt and risk, accumulate savings and make shrewd decisions about how to manage money.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Connecting the classroom to the real world is a key factor in keeping young people interested in their learning and we&#8217;re always looking for exciting and innovative ways to do that at Trinity Catholic High School,” said<strong> Dave Williams, principal at Trinity Catholic High School.</strong></span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>A Trinity Catholic High School team evaluates stock prices and performance graphs</strong></span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Each team was issued $500,000 in virtual cash to buy or sell shares in 26 public companies. The mock trades were projected to three giant screens that tracked stock prices, stock performance graphs and displayed school team names along with portfolio values and rankings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“April is Financial Literacy Month, and we are excited to partner with Junior Achievement in this important event,” said<strong> Richard Muskus Jr., President at Patriot Bank, the title sponsor for the event.</strong> “Teens competing in the Stock Market Challenge train for weeks or longer to understand the way the stock markets works, just as students might practice with their school athletic teams, and the knowledge they gain here will help them throughout their financial lives.  This event is important to Patriot Bank because it provides a high-paced financial learning environment that enables students to have fun and be </span>engaged,<span style="color: #000000;"> while learning valuable real-world lessons about how to prudently manage money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“It is really wonderful to see the students this engaged and excited about financial literacy,” said <strong>Jan Ursone, President of JASWCT.</strong> “This event illustrates the positive learning opportunity when we make them available to our youth.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Patriot Bank is among the local businesses and organizations that sponsored the event as part of its new initiative to help local schools and community organizations teach financial literacy. Samuel Davis, Patriot Bank’s EVP – Chief Credit Officer, rang the opening bell. Mr. Davis has served over a quarter century on the JASWCT board.</span></p>

<p>Stamford-based Patriot Bank has partnered with financial literacy firm Banzai Inc. to offer the company’s web-based educational curriculum to students in 15 schools in the neighboring New York and Connecticut counties. The bank, which has seven branches in Fairfield County and two in Westchester, will sponsor the program at no cost to students or school districts.</p>
<p>“Every single man, woman and child will eventually need to make decisions that will affect their credit score and financial well-being, from taking out a college loan to buying a car or house,” said Judith Corprew, executive vice president and chief compliance and risk officer at Patriot Bank. “Patriot Bank understands it’s critical that we provide the next generation with real-world tools and resources to make sound financial decisions.”</p>
<p>The 21st century teaching tool was rolled out earlier this year, Corprew said, and distributed to schools chosen by their economic demographic in Stratford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, Mount Vernon, Port Chester, White Plains and Yonkers.</p>
<p>“We felt they probably need financial literacy education a little more than some of the other schools, and they might not have opportunity to take personal debt courses on their own,” she said.</p>
<p>In both states, students are not required to take courses on personal finance prior to their graduation from high school.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen two-year-olds pick up their mom’s smartphones and they’re incredible with technology,” said Corprew. “Why not teach them how important it is to put money into a piggy bank?”</p>
<p>Banzai is an interactive online program that gives students a first-hand look at managing their own finances, providing them with real-life experiences without the risk of any real-life consequences.</p>
<p>Students are exposed to scenarios where they learn to pay bills and balance a budget. The program also teaches students about auto loans, bank statements, savings and more.</p>
<p>“Kids get their own accounts and they work through assignments that are based on real life,” said Morgan Vandagriff, co-founder of Banzai.</p>
<p>Students are given a virtual paycheck and must divide that money into various “jars,” from rent and food to car payments and insurance premiums. They control where their money goes and can prioritize which jars and accounts to put their cash into.</p>
<p>“It shows them how expensive being an adult is,” said Emily Inman, public relations manager at Banzai in Provo, Utah. “We get many comments from students along the lines of, ‘I had no clue how expensive rent was, or how much utilities are each month.’”</p>
<p>The Banzai curriculum also teaches students the importance of being prepared for any financial curveballs life may throw their way. They learn to manage unexpected expenses such as parking tickets, car repairs, interest charges and overdraft fees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><small>Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus Jr. wrote an op-ed about the importance of financial literacy that was published in the Sunday, April 9 edition of the Stamford Advocate</small></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to their international peers, American youth score below average when it comes to financial literacy or understanding how to manage money and make informed financial decisions, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
<p>April is Financial Literacy Month, a time when our leaders in Hartford ought to evaluate how Connecticut is faring on this vital educational topic. It is also an important occasion for young people to take inventory and sharpen financial skills to better ensure their economic security now and in the future.</p>
<p>Financial literacy is a necessary skill in all stages of life, from planning for college to making major purchases, like a home or car, to saving for retirement. Yet only 57 percent of U.S. adults are financially literate, according to a new report by Patriot Bank, Commitment to Financial Literacy 2017.</p>
<p>Improving financial literacy must start with teaching the next generation the key building blocks — earning, saving and investing, protecting, spending, and borrowing — to begin securing a more stable financial future.</p>
<p>There are more than half a million public school students in Connecticut, yet fewer than 7 percent of its high school students are required to take a financial literacy course to graduate, earning the state an unfortunate “F” grade on the annual National Report Card produced by the Champlain College Center for Financial Literacy.</p>
<p>Connecticut leaves it up to the 200 individual school districts to determine what, if any, curricula to establish in this subject, unfortunately resulting in most schools not requiring personal finance instruction. In contrast, neighboring New York State incorporates personal finance in high school economics and scores a “B” on the same report card.</p>
<p>Financial literacy can have wide-ranging economic impacts, particularly when it comes to investing in one’s future. In Connecticut, more than half (52 percent) of adults are in debt or not saving, according to FINRA Investor Education Foundation’s Financial Capability in the United States 2016 survey, making it apparent why 53 percent say it’s difficult to cover expenses and pay bills. It also helps explain why more than half (52 percent) of the state’s parents are not saving for their children’s college education or their own retirement (55 percent).</p>
<p>Financial decision-making begins early in life and increases as young people gain the independence to make more important choices. A teenager may first face the challenge of balancing the allotted monthly data on a cell phone plan; later, he or she confronts the prospect of paying for college without accruing burdensome debt; as a young adult, one of the first major financial decisions may be signing the lease on an apartment or buying a car.</p>
<p>Young people must be equipped with the skills to make smart decisions that can help them avoid ruinous debt or other financial hardships that can have lifelong consequences.</p>
<p>The emerging Generation Z, born after Millennials, roughly between the mid-1990s and 2010s, will be the largest growing group in the workplace and marketplace in the next five years. In the coming decades as well, the buying power future generations will be amplified by the “Great Transfer” of wealth, in which Baby Boomers will pass along an estimated $30 trillion to their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Teaching youth financial skills is critical to building a future with informed decision-makers, smart investors and prudent financial stewards, all key ingredients for a healthy economy.</p>
<p>Without public education requirements, our children’s financial knowledge largely depends upon personal experiences and lessons from parents and community organizations and it is important to support these efforts. These are important resources but they are not enough by themselves.</p>
<p>That is why Patriot Bank is embarking on a months-long effort to connect with community youth, college students, young adults and even veterans to amplify awareness of the critical ABC’s of financial literacy. It’s never too early or late to begin getting your own financial house in order.</p>
<p>Every individual needs to be financially literate. As parents, educators and community members, it’s our responsibility to impart lessons and share experiences that empower the next generation to become knowledgeable consumers and strong economic decision makers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly half of Americans lack basic financial literacy, and many young people are not being educated in this crucial topic, according to a new report from Patriot Bank, N.A. Overall, 43% of U.S. adults lack a basic understanding of financial skills, including proficiency in simple concepts of saving, investing, and debt, according to Patriot.</p>
<p>American teens fall behind their international counterparts in an 18-country assessment by the Organization for Economic Cooperations, with 18% of American teens not reaching basic proficiency in financial literacy, as compared to 15% globally.</p>

Additionally, half its residents are not saving for retirement.</p>
<p>The report <a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/white-paper/commitment-financial-literacy-2017/" target="_blank"><em>Commitment to Financial Literacy 2017</em></a>, by Patriot Bank, N.A., sounds the alarm on this urgent problem and helps identify opportunities for young people to acquire the financial skills that will help better secure their future. It outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>What financial literacy is and its lifelong importanc</li>
<li>Financial literacy impacts on everyday life</li>
<li>Why financial literacy education in Connecticut was graded “F” and New York “B”</li>
<li>Free resources &amp; educational tools for educators and parents</li>
</ul>
<p>“Patriot Bank is launching this important effort in the communities we serve to help provide the next generation with tools and resources to make smarter financial decisions,” said <strong>Richard Muskus, Patriot Bank President. </strong>“Financial literacy is a critical skill that is valuable at every stage of life and can have significant long-term effects. We are proud to partner with local schools and community organizations to help empower the younger generation to realize a stronger financial future.”</p>
<p>Among the topics covered in the 24-page report is the fact that Americans are beginning to experience the so-called “Great Transfer” of wealth, in which Baby Boomers will pass along an estimated $30 trillion of life savings to their children. Patriot Bank believes it is essential to equip the next generation with the financial literacy skills they need.</p>
<p>Financial literacy helps people judge and balance budgets, be they a teen managing a cell phone plan or dreaming of college or an adult struggling to make rent or mortgage payments, or saving for retirement.</p>
<p>There are no national educational standards for financial literacy, with requirements being determined at the state and local levels. In Connecticut, high schools do not require personal finance courses. In New York, the subject is incorporated in a half-year economics course.</p>
<p>To address some of these problems, Patriot Bank is offering educational seminars and resources to help local schools, veterans groups, community organizations, and parents teach this critical skill, including at Housatonic Community College, Trinity Catholic High School, Boys &amp; Girls Club of Northern Westchester and more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Banzai2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2450" src="https://patriotbank.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Banzai2.png" alt="Banzai" width="400" height="227" align="center" srcset="https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Banzai2.png 674w, https://bankpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Banzai2-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Local students are getting a free education in how to manage their money. Patriot Bank is working with Banzai, a national award-winning financial literacy program, to make curriculum available to Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, Mount Vernon, and Yonkers schools completely free.</p>
<p>Only 17 states require students to take a course in personal finance, whereas Connecticut and New York do not. In Connecticut, where school districts develop their own curricula, there are no statewide educational requirements to teach personal finance in high schools. In New York, personal finance instruction can be incorporated in a half-year high school economics course.</p>
<p>“Countless high school students graduate without ever receiving financial literary education, and the materials Patriot Bank is providing through Banzai will help correct that. Every single man, woman and child will eventually need to make decisions that will affect their credit score and financial well-being, from taking out a college loan to buying a car or house. Patriot Bank understands it’s critical that we provide the next generation with real-world tools and resources to make sound financial decisions,” said <strong>Judith Corprew, EVP, Chief Compliance, Risk and CRA Officer at Patriot Bank.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Banzai is a web-based financial literacy program. Kids get their own accounts, and they work through assignments that are based on real life,&#8221; <strong>Morgan Vandagriff, co-founder of Banzai</strong>, said. &#8220;But because Patriot Bank is sponsoring it, local schools get it for free. More than ever, it&#8217;s important that kids develop sound financial skills to prepare them for the real world, and Patriot Bank realizes that and they&#8217;re doing something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banzai is an interactive, online program supplemented by printed workbooks, which aligns with state curriculum requirements for personal finance education. It has become the largest program of its kind, servicing more than 27,000 teachers and available in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Patriot Bank has offered time, money, industry experience, and a variety of bank resources to help local schools teach personal finance in the classroom. Students using the program are exposed to real-life scenarios where they learn to pay bills and balance a budget – but it’s not always easy. Students must learn to manage unexpected expenses such as parking tickets, interest charges and overdraft fees. The educational program also introduces students to auto loans, bank statements, entertainment costs, savings and more.</p>
<p>“Too often students get out of school and they just aren&#8217;t ready for the financial roller coasters life can give us,” Vandagriff said. “Banzai teaches students to navigate those twists and turns and come out on top. We&#8217;re excited to work with Patriot Bank to improve financial literacy in local schools<strong>.</strong>”</p>
